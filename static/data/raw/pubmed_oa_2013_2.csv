"CONFLICT OF INTEREST: NONE DECLARED Goal The goals of this study are to: a) determine the prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPNP) in hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2; b) determine the frequency of DPNP in hospitalized patients with type 2 DM in relation to gender, duration of diabetes, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c; c) identify the dominant DPNP symptoms and the presence of variable risk factors in hospitalized patients; and d) determine the frequency and motor nerve conduction velocity of n. peroneus (electroneuromyography) in relation to the treatment of type 2 DM in hospitalized patients with DPNP. Material and methods The study was conducted on 141 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized at the Neurological clinic of Clinical Center of Sarajevo University in the period from June 1 2009 to June 1 2010. All patients included in the study were older than 18. Values determined for all subjects are: age, sex, dominant symptoms, duration of type 2 DM, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, motor conduction velocity of n. peroneus, diabetes risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, obesity) and DM treatment type. Results Of 141 patients with type 2 DM, DPNP was confirmed in 50 patients (35.5%). Men were slightly more represented in the total sample (51.8%). In a sample of patients with DPNP, there were slightly more male patients (n=26; 52%). The average age of patients with DPNP was higher in men (58.3±12.5) (p<0.05). The average age of the patients with DPNP was 55.1± 13.2. Average values of fasting glucose was higher in the group of patients with DPNP (11.032±5.4 mmol/l) compared to patients without DPNP (9.7±2.8 mmol/l) (p<0.05). Mean values of HbA1C were higher in patients with DPNP (8.212±3.3%) compared to patients without DPNP (6.9±2.6%) (p<0.05). Analysis of DM duration between patients with and without DPNP did not show statistically significant difference (chi-square=3.858, p>0.05). In both groups, most of the patients had duration of DM over 10 years, with a minimum duration of DM of 12 months. There are statistically significant differences in applied DM therapy by gender (chi-square=11.939, p<0.05). Hypertension was more frequent in women (79.2%:69.2%), hyperlipidemia was equally presented in both sexes (50%:50%), obesity was more prevalent among women (25%:7.7%), while alcoholism and smoking were more frequent in men (7.7%:0%; 34.6%:8.3%). There are statistically significant differences in the prevalence of risk factors by gender (chi-square=10.013, p<0.05). Conclusions The DPNP incidence was higher in patients with longer duration of the disease, but without significant gender differences. Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c were significantly higher in patients with DPNP compared to patients without DPNP (p<0.05). The dominant symptoms of DPNP were paresthesia (44%) and hypoesthesia (28%). Regarding variable risk factors, the most common were hypertension and hyperlipidemia, without statistical significance in gender distribution, while smoking was significantly more common in men than women (34.6%:8.3%). DPNP was present in 43.2% of men who use insulin therapy, while 54.2% of women with DPNP used oral therapy. The lowest frequency of DPNP was found in patients treated with combined therapy. Motor conduction velocity of n. peroneus was significantly lower in men using insulin therapy and/or combined therapy (p<0.05), whereas in patients on oral therapy there was no significant gender difference. Timely DM type 2 diagnosis with proper treatment and electromyoneurographic monitoring (especially in older men) can prevent onset of diabetic polyneuropathy and contribute to its successful treatment.","Assessment of Diabetic Polyneuropathy in Inpatient Care: Fasting Blood Glucose, HbA1c, Electroneuromyography and Diabetes Risk Factors",3766543,24039336.0,2013
"CONFLICT OF INTEREST: NONE DECLARED Introduction The collection of platelets by apheresis is considered as a very great progress in transfusion medicine. A larger yield (total number of collected platelets) is obtained if the donor has a greater number of initial platelets and if the separation is done in a shorter time. One of the parameters is also the efficiency of the platelet collection (expressed in percentage) on the value of which different factors may have direct or indirect influence. Aims To calculate the efficiency of platelet collection with the separator Fenval Baxter AMICUS and to compare the efficiency of platelet collection with this separator in relation to the initial value of donor hematocrit. Donors and Methods The donors who participated in this study were divided into groups according to the value of the donor’s ‘hematocrit before separation. Group C consisted of donors whose initial value of the hematocrit was lower or equal to 46%. Group D consisted of donors whose initial value of the hematocrit was higher than 46%. The process was carried out on Fenval Baxter AMICUS. The expected efficiency of the collection was obtained by dividing the total number of collected cells by the expected total number of processed cells, i.e. the total number of cells passed through the equipment. Results In the 258 separations which satisfied the fixed criteria were men in 226 cases (87.6%) and women in 32 (12.4%). There is a statically significant difference in the platelet value between the groups and this value is higher in group D than in group C. The average value of platelets before separation was 46.66. The range of minimal and maximal value is from 38.8 to 52.4 ±2.78. The initial value of hematocrits of the donor does not intervene in the length of the separation, but it has a significant effect on the efficiency of the platelet collection. Increases in the number of hematocrits significantly decrease the efficiency of platelet collection. In practice it means that we can base on this fact make a better selection of donors. In this kind selection, one should prefer a donor with a higher number of initial platelets and lower levels of hematocrits. In that way we can collect a more important yield, have a shorter length of separation and increase the efficiency of platelet collection. Its advantage is as well medical because of a more important yield but also financial because of the decrease of the length of the separation and the increase in efficiency. Key words: value of hematocrits, donors, apheresis, platelets, efficiency.",Initial Values of Donor Hematocrit and Efficiency of Plateletpheresis,3766539,24058252.0,2013
"Objective: In this work, role of the adrenergic nerve system (alpha 1  and beta 2 ) in adjustment of the bronchomotor tonus in healthy people was researched. Methods: Parameters of the lung function are determined by Body plethysmography. Raw and ITGV were registered and SRaw was calculated as well. Aerosolization is done with standard aerosolizing machines – Asema. Results: Results gained shows that following the blockade of beta- 2  adrenergic receptor with Propranolol (20 mg–aerosol), stimulation of alpha adrenergic receptor with Oxedrine (120 mg-aerosol) and blockage of these receptors with Tolazoline (20 mg-aerosol), does not change significantly the bronchomotor tonus of the tracheobronchial tree (p > 0.1). Meanwhile, stimulation of the beta -2  adrenergic receptor with Hexoprenaline (2 inh × 0.2 mg) is associated with a significant increase of the peripheral resistance of the airways (p < 0.01). Conclusion: This suggests that the activity of the alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor, unlike the activity of the beta 2 -adrenergic receptor in the healthy people smooth musculature, is not significant and as such is insufficient to oppose to the tonic activities of the cholinergic system.",Activity of the Adrenergic Nerve System in the Airways Permeability of Healthy Persons,3916168,24554803.0,2013

Regardless the extensive application of pulsed ultrasound of low intensity, continuous ultrasound has a better analgesis effect, which is explained by its mechanism of action. Aims: The main research objective of this study was to determine the effect of continuous ultrasound to pain caused by degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system in the intensity and duration of ultrasound treatment. Other objectives are entailed determining the correlation between the degree of pain reduction with: location of pain, age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Material and methods: The study included 68 patients with chronic pain localized in the region of the spine or major joints of the extremities, depending on the localization of the degenerative changes. Patients are divided into two groups. The first group was treated with 10 applications of continuous ultrasound with frequency of 1 MHz, intensity 0.4 W/cm2 for 8 minutes, and the other group with 10 applications of ultrasound with frequency of 1 MHz, intensity 0.8 W/cm 2 for 4 minutes. Results and Discussion: Pain intensity was assessed before and after ultrasound therapy performed by subjective visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, numbered from 0-10, where 0 is the rating for the state of no pain, and 10 grades for severe pain. The average VAS improvement in the first group was 3.97, and 4.74 in second one. The results of F (1.66) = 2.93, p = 0.09 analysis of variance showed no significance difference between the average improvement of two groups. Correlation between the degree of pain reduction showed significance only with BMI, or that higher BMI is associated with a lower degree of pain reduction. The results of this study showed that application of continuous ultrasound in patients with chronic pain, caused by degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal system, led to a significant reduction in pain. Different intensity and duration of ultrasound application showed no significant effect on the degree of pain reduction. Body mass index showed significant negative correlation with the degree of pain reduction, but age, gender and location of pain did not show significant correlation.",Therapeutic Ultrasound and Pain in Degenerative Diseases of Musculoskeletal System,3804475,24167385.0,2013
"Introduction: Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density, making bones become less rigid, and therefore susceptible to fractures, either spontaneously or with force, which is lower than otherwise needed for healthy bones fractured. Nearly 10% of the world population and 30% of women after menopause, suffer from osteoporosis. Clinical assessment of osteoporosis in family medicine is key to prevention, early detection and treatment of osteoporosis. Objective: To investigate the possibility of early detection and diagnosis of osteoporosis by analyzing the risk factors for osteoporosis and to compare the results with the parameters obtained by ultrasound densitometry of calcaneus, and determine the relationship of calcaneus densitometry with DXA findings, as the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Patients and methods: The study included all patients of Family Medicine Kalesija Team 1, aged 50 years and over, a total of 711 patients, of whom 425 were women and 286 men. In all patients we assessed the existence of the following risk factors for osteoporosis: Constitutional: gender, age, weight, constitution, menarche and menopause, loss of height and stooped posture; Living habits: smoking, alcohol consumption, coffee, physical activity, and medications: long-term use corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, antacids, thyroid hormones. Comorbidity: history of fractures, hyperthyroidism, COPD, Chussing’s disease, diabetes. In the group of high-risk patients determined by the clinical assessment, quantitative ultrasound densitometry screening was carried out. Monitoring parameters derived with densitometry: the value of T-score, BUA (Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation), SOS (Speed of Sound), QUI (Quantitative Ultrasound Index). To confirm the diagnosis of osteoporosis, in all patients with positive findings using ultrasound densitometry (T score lower than 2.5), another densitometry was performed by standard DXA method. Results: The incidence of osteoporosis was 96% in women and 4% in men. Differences in prevalence between men and women are statistically significant. People with and without osteoporosis significantly differ in gender, age, weight, constitution (BMI-Body Mass Index). The parameters that distinguish those with and without osteoporosis: age, weight, height, BMI, gender. Out of the total of 711 patients, in 11% of patients the clinical evaluation showed the existence of high risk of osteoporosis. In 9.8% patients, the values were determined by ultrasound densitometry, where T score was lower than 2.5 what induces a high risk of fractures, and for 8.8% patients the DXA confirmed the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Conclusion: Clinical assessment of osteoporosis in the family medicine clinic performed in timely and focused history of risk factors for osteoporosis, with additional findings from quantitative densitometry of calcaneus, was sufficient for the early detection and screening of patients with high risk for osteoporosis. With good clinical assessment of osteoporosis it will be necessary to send all patients who enter the high-risk group to undergo ultrasound densitometry of calcaneus, to make it possible to determine the risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis in time, and then refer patients for further processing and DXA measurements according to the guidelines by the WHO.",Assessment of Osteoporosis in Family Medicine Obtained by Ultrasound Densitometry,3916165,24554805.0,2013

"Introduction Abnormal aortic function in hypertension is generally attributed to accelerated breakdown of elastin in the aorta, leading to dilatation of the lumen and stiffening of the wall as elastin is replaced with stiffer collagen. Aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Vascular stiffening can activate endothelium which in turn may promote atherogenesis. Modulation of arterial stiffness has been shown to be successfully managed via changes in lifestyle and put under control of hypertension pharmacologically with antihypertensive drugs and statins. Methods Hundred and forty four patients have been enrolled in this study. They have been divided in two groups, with hypertension and group of control. Groups were with no age difference. Results Group with hypertension were with reduced aortic strain, distensibility (compliance) and have higher stiffness than control group; GrHTA =9.3 compared to GC=5.4. After successful treatment of hypertension with antihypertensives and statins, for two years, these parameters showed improvement, but still remain out of normal range compared to control group; 7.6 vs. 5.38. Conclusions Hypertensive patients have reduced aortic elasticity and increased stiffness which can be stopped and improved after treatment with antihypertensive and statin.",Aortic Compliance and Stiffness Among Severe Longstanding Hypertensive and Non-hypertensive,3610589,23572854.0,2013

"Primary malignant heart tumors represent rare entities where fibro sarcoma represents about 3% of all. Introducing the patient: A 15 years old patient with cardiac insufficiency (heart failure) symptoms, such as weakness, cyanosis, palpitations and breathing difficulties; enlargement of upper mediastinum and pleural effusion. Through echocardiography a pericardial effusion and intracavitary thrombus in atrium was diagnosed. With computed tomography is diagnosed a tumoral mass in right atrium which is also spread in the right ventricle of the heart. Tumor is completely removed; pat histology result showed primary fibro sarcoma of the heart. At that time no metastasis was found. Conclusion. Primary malignant heart tumors may manifest like cardiac insufficiency or like systemic diseases. Fibrosarcomas are rare and have bad prognosis. On average patients can live around six months after initial symptoms appeared and diagnosis of the tumor was done. In the case of cardiac insufficiency with differential diagnosis we should also think of heart tumors, which could certainly be proved for or eliminated by echocardiography.",Primary Fibro Sarcoma of the Heart,3804504,24167396.0,2013

"Aim Emphasizing circumstances that determine increasingly popular surgical approach of breast conserving surgery (BCS), used in lower grade breast tumors, while maintaining survival that is found when more radical procedures are used. Patients and methods Several leading oncological protocols in the world are compared, using PubMed database, and our own experience. Data gathered are compared to conclusions of Consensus Conference on Breast Conservation (Milan, 2005). Furthermore, surgical contraindications found in our everyday work are considered, having in mind satisfactory cosmetic outcome, as well as keeping the 1 cm border of “clear” edges. Such more practical problems of edge detection can compromise BCS results. Results After observing several relevant protocols, we found very high frequency of mastectomy vs. BCS, despite the fact that stage of disease was low. We also found only 20% of absolute contraindications for BCS. Most frequent contraindication for BCS was multicentricity of the tumor (with micro calcifications), especially in ductal in situ carcinoma. Conclusion BCS followed by radiation therapy with tumor-free edges is standard procedure in treatment of T1 and small T2 breast cancers. This approach implies higher risk of local recurrence (LR), although local recurrence is low (1% per year), with rates of survival similar to radical procedures.",Criteria and Procedures for Breast Conserving Surgery,3610577,23572855.0,2013
"CONFLICT OF INTEREST: NONE DECLARED Introduction The quality of the teaching-learning process at the universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and abroad depends mainly of infrastructure that includes an optimal teaching space, personnel and equipment, in accordance with existing standards and norms. For the assessment of teaching at the faculties, the opinion of students is very important ( 4 ,  5 ). Students are often unhappy with the educational process. Goal To compare the results of the teaching process evaluation between students studying according to the Bologna system and the old system of education. Material and methods We used the questionnaire as a carrier of data created with variables relevant for assessing the success of the educational process at the Medical Faculty in Sarajevo. The survey was conducted among students of the sixth year of the Medical Faculty in Sarajevo. There were 103 students surveyed, of which 32 were studying according to the Bologna and 71 by the old concept of studies. Results and discussion Results of survey which measured students satisfaction with the educational process (theoretical and practical instruction, interactive learning, testing, use of IT and technical aids in teaching, availability of instructional literature etc.) lead us to the conclusion that the lowest satisfaction is associated with factors depending on financial resources, specifically related to library funds and the degree of computerization of educational process, and also with the level of teachers capability to convey knowledge to students with the application of modern medical information technology and technical teaching aids.",Quality Assessment of Medical Education at Faculty of Medicine of Sarajevo University – Comparison of Assessment Between Students in Bologna Process and Old System of Studying,3766545,24039331.0,2013
"Introduction As a natural phenomenon in the patient’s medication therapy, medication clinical complications potentially or concretely interrupt medical care consequential productivity for the patients. Medication related clinical complications include drug errors, drug side effects, drug interactions and drug usage-related challenges. The present research intends to explore the role that the Pharmacy Information System (PIS) may play in the management of medication complications with reference to the pharmaceutical societies of America and Australia in selected teaching, private and social services hospitals of the city of Isfahan. Methodology As an applied, descriptive-analytical study, this study has been conducted in teaching, private and social services hospitals situated in the city of Isfahan in 2011. The research population consisted of the PISs used in the hospitals under study. Research sample was the same as the population. The data collection instrument used was a self-designed checklist developed based on the guidelines of the American Society of Health System Pharmacists and Pharmaceutical Society of Australia validity of which was assessed by expert professors’ views. The data, collected by observation and interview methods, were put into SPSS 18 software to be analyzed. Findings The findings of the study revealed that among the 19 hospitals in question, the highest and lowest ranks in observing the societies of the pharmacists’ established standards related to medication therapy, i.e. registration of drug use status and drug interactions belonged to social services hospitals (mean score of %10.1) and private hospitals (mean score of %6.24), respectively. Conclusion Based on the findings, it can be claimed that the hospitals in question did not pay due attention to standards established by the societies of pharmacists regarding the medication therapy including register of drug usage status, drug interactions and drug side effects in their PISs. Hence, more thought must be given to the capabilities of the PIS in supporting the medication-related decisions and drug errors management so as to promote the treatment quality and satisfy medication therapy goals.",The Role of Evaluation Pharmacy Information System in Management of Medication Related Complications,3610581,23572858.0,2013

"Introduction: The aim of prenatal diagnosis is to detect fetal structural and genetic abnormalities. Used are different medical methods, procedures, processes and techniques. For this reason we can speak about the prevention and detection of hereditary diseases and congenital anomalies in the unborn fetus. Material and methods: The authors analyzed the results of early amniocentesis tests performed during 2009 in Institute for Gynecology, Infertility and Perinatology “Mehmedbasic” in Sarajevo. Performed is 299 analysis of amniotic fluid after amnion puncture done in the Institute or at the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics (GAK) Sarajevo. Results and Discussion: Indications for the performance of early amniocentesis were: age greater over 35 (84.9%), positive ultrasound markers (1.6%), positive biochemical markers (5.6%) and positive family history for hereditary diseases (7.9%). Detected was 19 pathological cariograms or very high 7% of the total annual number of amniocentesis. An analysis of the distribution of pregnant women in relation to the indication of the result of cytogenetic analysis for each table made positive predictive value (PPV). For indicator age PPV was 0.11, 0.66 for ultrasound markers, for biochemical markers 0.13, for other indications–0.04. The logistic regression model (odds -ratio 11.234 ) indicate a positive ultrasound findings in relation to the year indicates that the risk to gain abnormal fetal karyotype 13 times higher when using only age as an indication for early amniocentesis. Of the 19 pathological cariogram largest number refers to M.Down (10), Sy. Edwards was detected in 2 patients, Sy. Klinefelter in 3, mosaicism in 3 and translocation gene in two of the fetus. Conclusion: The authors would like to acknowledge a very high percentage of pathological cariogram risk groups, the extension of indications for RAC indicate the value of ultrasound markers as a good screening methods and the need for social incentives to perform screening tests and early amniocentesis in B&H in order to prevent genetic abnormalities.",Early Amniocentesis as a Method of Choice in Diagnosing Gynecological Diseases,3916177,24554804.0,2013
"Background: The conduct of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is deemed ethical only if we are in state of “equipoise” as to which treatment would be most beneficial for the patients. Individual equipoise applies to an individual clinician or a member of ethical, institutional review board (IRB), whilst collective equipoise refers to the profession as a whole. It is argued that physicians are not bound by the equipoise but their actions are directed by the confines of the expert opinion. Experts can agree or disagree in various proportions on the merit of a given treatment. Hence, the collective equipoise will be often incomplete. In turn, the opinions of content expert in the field of the proposed trial influence the IRB members’ decision regarding trial approval. Methods: We conducted a survey of IRB members at University of South Florida and the IRB members attending the bioethics conference organized in Clearwater, Florida, USA. The survey was made available as hard copy (paper based) and included six hypothetical scenarios outlining clinical trials targeted at measuring the collective equipoise. We defined the collective equipoise as the situation when survey participants were equally split (50:50) in their decision regarding whether a proposed clinical trial would be ethical to conduct. The opinion of 100 experts in the field expressed as proportion of experts favoring treatment A vs. B in each of the five scenarios was made available to the participants. Results: The response rate of our survey was 33% (71/218). Fifty percent of the IRB members would approve an RCT addressing the efficacy of two drugs for the management of headache even if 80% of experts favor one treatment over another (median: 80%; third quartile: 80%). Similarly, half of participating IRB members would approve the study when the median distribution of equipoise among experts was 70% (70 in favor of treatment A vs. 30 in favor of treatment B) for treatment of leukemia, 60% for treatment of geriatric patients and 70% for treatment of newborns. Half of IRB members would approve the study when the median distribution of equipoise among experts was 70% for treatment for leukemia in dogs and 85% for leukemia in rats (and 25% of IRB members would approve such a study even if 100% of experts favors one treatment over another). None of the demographic features of respondents affected collective equipoise. Conclusions: This is the first study assessing collective equipoise among ethical committee/IRB members. Our study findings show that IRB members perceived that conduct of a trial enrolling humans is unethical when the equipoise level is beyond 80% (80:20 distribution of uncertainty). IRB members require a higher level of equipoise when it comes to testing a new drug in humans than in animals. A relatively high level of equipoise is needed for IRB members to be comfortable to approve trials involving life-threatening situations, children and elderly patients.",At What Level of Collective Equipoise Does a Randomized Clinical Trial Become Ethical for the Members of Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committees?,3804473,24167382.0,2013

"Objective: To determine the effectiveness of the use of the SIP score and the quality of life impairment in patients with ileal conduit and orthotropic ileal derivations by Hautmann and AbolEnein/Ghoneim. Methods: Prospectively evaluated 146 patients in different age groups. In 66 patients ileal conduit derivation was performed, in 20 patients orthotropic derivation using Hautman technique was recorded and in 20 of them AbolEnein/Ghoneim was used. Prior to examining patients with urinary diversions, 40 patients with minor urological symptoms not requiring any active treatment, were surveyed in order to validate SIP score. Six months after the operation, all patients with urinary diversions filled the SIP score questionnaire. Results: Using Crombach’s Alpha equation the high reliability of SIP questionnaire was proven. Average scale value was 0,93. Using descriptive statistics mean values of all categories and dimensions of the SIP questionnaire of examined patients were determined, calculated according to the questionnaire manual being converted to percentage. Total value of SIP score for the ileal conduit group was 34,76% and in orthotropic derivation 18,52% respectively. For Hautmann procedure total SIP score was 18,35% and for AbolEnein/Ghoneim 18,7%. In the control group total SIP score was 9%. The most influential dimensions on the total score of ileal conduit were physical and psycho-social, while independent dimension did not significantly influent total SIP score. Conclusion: Taking into consideration the lack of questionnaires on quality of life for urinary derivations, SIP score as a general disease influence to the quality of life questionnaire represents a reliable alternative for objectification and quantification of the quality of life upon urinary derivation. According to this instrument, orthotropic derivations provide significantly better quality of life compared to ileal conduit.","Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) Score, a Good Alternative Instrument for Measuring Quality of Life in Patients with Ileal Urinary Diversions",3804474,24167383.0,2013

Breast implants consist of a silicone outer shell and a filler (most commonly silicone gel or saline). Approximately 5 to 10 million women worldwide have breast implants. Histomorphometric study to evaluate the biological tissue compatibility of silicone implants suitable for plastic surgery and the adverse effects and risks of this material. Thirty Wistar white rats received subcutaneous implants and the revestiment of silicone gel Silimed ®®, and randomized into six groups of five animals each, according to the type of implanted material and the time of sacrifice. Eight areas of 60.11mm2 corresponding to the obtained surgical pieces were analyzed, counting mesenchymal cells, eosinophils, and foreign body giant cells, observing an acceptable biocompatibility in all implants, for subsequent statistical analysis by Tukey test. Silicone gel showed inflammation slightly greater than for other groups, with tissue reactions varying from light to moderate, whose result was the formation of a fibrous capsule around the material, recognized by the organism as a foreign body. Despite frequent local complications and adverse outcomes, this research showed that the silicone and top layer presented an acceptable chronic inflammatory reaction, which did not significantly differ from the control group. In general, it is possible to affirm that silicone gel had acceptable levels of biocompatibility, confirmed the rare presence of foreign body giant cells, and when of the rupture, formed a fibrous capsule around the material, separating the material of the organism.",Evaluation of the Biocompatibility of Silicone Gel Implants – Histomorphometric Study,3766542,24039333.0,2013

"In scientific circles, the reference is the information that is necessary to the reader in identifying and finding used sources. The basic rule when listing the sources used is that references must be accurate, complete and should be consistently applied. On the other hand, quoting implies verbatim written or verbal repetition of parts of the text or words written by others that can be checked in original. Authors of every new scientific article need to explain how their study or research fits with previous one in the same or similar fields. A typical article in the health sciences refers to approximately 20-30 other articles published in peer reviewed journals, cite once or hundreds times. Citations typically appear in two formats: a) as in-text citations where the sources of information are briefly identified in the text; or b) in the reference list at the end of the publication (book chapter, manuscript, article, etc.) that provides full bibliographic information for each source.

Material and Methods We studied 300 patients, of them 150 patients with non-obese, normotensive, uncomplicated type 2 diabetes, in five years duration of disease and 150 healthy control subjects. Of all patients, 100 with type 2 diabetes, and 100 patients from the control group underwent exercise test on a treadmill. All participants underwent both CE and TDI echocardiography. With TDI, lateral E’ peak velocity, atrial velocity (A’), their ratio (E’/A’) and systolic velocity (S’) were measured. Diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed by tissue Doppler imaging, and the following criterion was met: E’/A’ ratio <1. Cardiac function with CE was without significant features in the two groups. Results and Discussion Using TDI interrogation, diabetic subjects showed a lower E’ velocity (10,75±1,2 vs. 14±3 cm/s, p<0,001), an increased A’ velocity (10,65±1,8 vs. 11±3 cm/s, p<0,02), and a reduced E/A ratio (0,82±0,04 vs. 1,17±1,4, p<0,001), S (8.92±3,80 vs. 9,30±3.30 cm/sec); E/A (1,17±0.55, p<0,01). In diabetic patients, after the exercise stress test performance, the myocardial velocity increase is registered for wave E’=1,27 cm/sec (12,01%), for wave A’=1,7 cm/sec (15,9%), reduced ratio E’/A’ (0.89±0,1 cm/sec 9,0%) and S’=1,3 cm/sec (14,77%). Whereas, mean myocardial velocity values in examined control group after the exercise stress test were higher as follows: E’=2,7 cm/sec (19%), A’=2,1 cm/sec (14%), E’/A’=0,8 cm/sec (12%), and S’=2,7 cm/sec (18%). Myocardial diastolic dysfunction due to reduced exercise tolerance can be evidenced by TDI in type 2 diabetic subjects, even in the presence of a normal cardiac function with CE and symptom free diabetic patients in rest. Therefore, our findings could justify the use of Tissue Doppler imaging for diastolic function assessment in diabetics with otherwise non significant features on CE.",Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction in Asymptomatic Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Detection and Evaluation by Tissue Doppler Imaging,3766541,24039335.0,2013

"Introduction: Gastric cancer is one of the most common tumors in humans and is on the 14th place by frequency in the United States and it is at the 8th place by the mortality rate. In the world it takes seventh place by incidence. Today prevail the opinion and the surveys show, that it is twice as common in men as compared to women. Although there are advancements in diagnostics it must be noted that gastric cancer is still discovered late and when it already has metastasized, so that the therapeutic approach is limited and low survival rate. Patients and Methods: The study was retrospective-prospective, which covered the period from 2011 to 2012 and was performed at the Clinic of Gastroenterohepatology, Clinical Center of Sarajevo University. The study included 50 patients with gastric cancer, 34 men and 16 women. All patients underwent gastroscopy and according to tumor lesions localization divided into 3 regions: cardia, corpus and antropyloric region. Tumor lesions were biopted with histologically confirmation of gastric wall cancer. All patients underwent CT of gastric wall, CT of the abdomen and in some cases EUS was performed also. Goal: To prove by available diagnostic methods (endoscopy, CT and EUS) the presence of gastric cancer, histologically validate it and determine localization according to regions. To determine by CT the thickness of the stomach wall or the penetration of tumor lesions, the presence of enlarged lymph nodes and possible metastases. Record by EUS the progression of malignant processes in depth to layers of the wall, surrounding tissue metastases and enlarged lymph nodes. Determine the correlation between the measured parameters. Results: Our study showed that the localization of tumors at the cardia was represented in 15.31%, corpus in 17.36% and antropyloric region 16.33%. Median age he was 65.5 years with a standard deviation of 11.04. We failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in verified findings by EUS and age as well as endoscopic findings and age. Also there is no statistically significant difference between the CT scan and endoscopy XT = 5.99 and α = 0.05 = 0.63 XE, XE <Xt. There is a significant difference between the results of CT by age groups (XT = 3.84 at α = 0.05, XF = 0.05, EE> XT) and endoscopic findings and age (XT = 3.84 at α = 0.01, = 0.01 XE, XE> XT). Conclusion: Our study showed that gastric cancer are more common in men than women, metastases were more common in the elderly population, there were no significant deviations from the endoscopic findings and CT findings. EUS was performed in a small number of patients and showed as a good method because it gave accurate information about the penetration depth. Endoscopy, EUS and CT are ideal methods in diagnostic and staging of gastric cancer before the surgery.","Comparability of Diagnostic Methods: Proximal Endoscopy, CT and EUS in Determining Stomach Tumor Localization and their Importance in the Preoperative Analysis of Process Progression",3916169,24554798.0,2013

"The Aim: To show histopathological diagnoses after colonoscopic polypectomy in the University Hospital Center (KBC) Split with recommendations on further follow-up colonoscopy depending on the endoscopic and histological findings. Patients and Methods: The study included 2842 patients who underwent colonoscopy in a two-year period (2008-2009), followed by a detailed analysis of 350 patients in which one or more polyps were simultaneously removed and 163 patients who were only sampled for histological analysis. Patients from the National Program for Colorectal Cancer Prevention and patients in which colonoscopy is indicated as part of daily outpatient or inpatient treatment were included as well. Results: During 2008 and 2009 in KBC Split, out of a total of 2842 colonoscopies, 350 patients underwent colonoscopic polypectomy, whereby 618 polyps were removed (1-8 polyps in individual patients), while in 163 patients only biopsy specimens were sampled. Out of the total of 557 polyps sent for histological analysis, 236 were hyperplastic (42%), 193 were identified as tubular adenoma (35%), 84 were tubulovillous (15%), 18 villous (3%), 9 were adenocarcinoma (2%) and other 17 (3%). In 35 (15.4%) polyps high-grade dysplasia was found. The largest number of nonpolypectomized changes confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma (76-47%), adenomas and hyperplastic polyps were 37 (22%) and regular findings 23 (14%). Mucosal high-grade dysplasia was demonstrated in 35 (23.1%) biopsied changes. Conclusion: Colonoscopies with polypectomy decreased the risk of the formation of colorectal cancer in these patients almost to the level of risk in patients who have not even had a polyp during colonoscopy. Arguably the best method of prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer are already widely established national programs. The next qualitative level is constantly improving the quality of colonoscopy with clear criteria and the establishment of a body to evaluate the performers and the equipment, and making recommendations on the colonoscopy follow-up intervals depending on endoscopic and histopathological findings of patients who for any reason underwent colonoscopy.",Colonoscopic Polypectomies and Recommendations on the Colonoscopy Follow-up Intervals Depending on Endoscopic and Histopathological Findings,3804476,24167384.0,2013

"Background Knowledge economy has become increasingly broad over the years and identification of core journals in this field can be useful for librarians in journal selection process and also for researchers to select their studies and finding Appropriate Journal for publishing their articles. Present research attempts to determine core journals of Knowledge Economy indexed in LISTA (Library and Information Science and Technology). Methods The research method was bibliometric and research population include the journals indexed in LISTA (From the start until the beginning of 2011) with at least one article a bout “knowledge economy”. For data collection, keywords about “knowledge economy”–were extracted from the literature in this area–have searched in LISTA by using title, keyword and abstract fields and also taking advantage of LISTA thesaurus. By using this search strategy, 1608 articles from 390 journals were retrieved. The retrieved records import in to the excel sheet and after that the journals were grouped and the Bradford’s coefficient was measured for each group. Finally the average of the Bradford’s coefficients were calculated and core journals with subject area of “Knowledge economy” were determined by using Bradford’s formula. Findings By using Bradford’s scattering law, 15 journals with the highest publication rates were identified as “Knowledge economy” core journals indexed in LISTA. In this list “Library and Information update” with 64 articles was at the top. “ASLIB Proceedings” and “Serials” with 51 and 40 articles are next in rank. Also 41 journals were identified as beyond core that “Library Hi Tech” with 20 articles was at the top. Conclusion Increased importance of knowledge economy has led to growth of production of articles in this subject area. So the evaluation of journals for ranking these journals becomes a very challenging task for librarians and generating core journal list can provide a useful tool for journal selection and also quick and easy access to information.

"Introduction Patient bill of rights (PBR) calls for equal rights to access health services for all patients. It makes a foundation for preserving good relationships between patients, doctors and other healthcare staffs. Third Edition of national PBR was published in Iran in 2009. On the other hand, developing national wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) is now one of the strategic goals of Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. EHR as a basic repository for all related information provides access to the necessary data to organize, store and manage them. It also makes an additional support to the legal aspects of healthcare services, increases staff information about patient rights, and raises them to respect these rights. This article reviews how EHR standards can help to institutionalize the PBR. Methods To do that, we have collected some important topics of PBR in Iran. Then we used some valid references on Electronic health record standards like ASTM, ISO, HL7 and CEN to review existing standards. The Main issues regarding patient rights derived from these standards were: privacy, confidentiality, and secrecy, access levels to patient information, medical care in emergency situations, patient autonomy and authentication (electronic signature). In each topic, the most relevant standard phrases are marked. Results Developing EHR creates an opportunity to establish patient rights in its structure. To internalize them, there are some reliable EHR standards like ASTM and ISO 13606-1 that implementing them could be very fruitful.",Do Electronic Health Records Standards Help Implementing Patient Bill of Rights in Hospitals?,3610580,23572856.0,2013

"Introduction: Periodontal disease belongs to a group of diseases with more than one cause, it is a disease of a multifactorial etiology. Although bacteria are the main cause of the disease, immunoinflammatory reaction of the host is responsible for the majority of destructive changes in periodontal tissue. The main issue in the evaluation of the success of periodontal therapy is the pluralism of the bacteria and their dynamic changes during the duration, on the one hand, and the possible inaccuracy of classical microbiological analysis in determination of the dominant role of a microorganism, or the success of its reduction or elimination, on the other. Thanks to advances of microbiology and technological development, it is possible to make an assessment of specific microorganisms in a large number of samples of sub-gingival plaque with extreme precision, using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The development of laser technology and the discovery of its significant antimicrobial effects have introduced and presented this treatment modality as a possible auxiliary method of periodontitis treatment. Materials and Methods: The sample for the study estimating the efficiency of application of diode lasers in the reduction of periodontal pockets consisted of 1164 periodontal pockets in 24 subjects of both sexes. For laser irradiation of periodontal pockets a diode laser was used, a low-power laser (SmilePro 980, Biolitec, Germany), working in a mode precisely tuned for treatment of periodontal pockets. All subjects underwent: general anamnesis, periodontal status, and orthopantogram radiograph analysis. Following a standard periodontal preparation, a sample of subgingival plaque was collected for molecular-biological analysis (real-time PCR method) prior to laser irradiation of periodontal pockets, immediately following the irradiation, and during the control examination 3 months after irradiation. Results: The results of the molecular-biological analysis of target periodontal pathogens Actinobacillus (Aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans (AA) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) isolated from periodontal pockets prior to laser irradiation, immediately after laser irradiation, and at the control examination after 3 months were processed statistically (using real-time PCR method). The results showed that there was a statistically significant decrease in CT values for the tested bacteria immediately after treatment and the control examination, compared with the level of CT values for the same bacteria before treatment. Conclusions: Based on the obtained results, we concluded that diode laser irradiation reduces the number of active periodontal pathogens. We believe that the use of diode lasers, as a supplementary method in the treatment of periodontal disease, is extremely useful and efficient, and can be recommended as part of standard clinical practice.",Application of a Diode Laser in the Reduction of Targeted Periodontal Pathogens,3916176,24554796.0,2013
"Purpose To investigate the connection between alexithymia and somatic illness, or, somatization, in veterans suffering from chronic combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. Methods Croatian combat veterans (N=127) were studied at the Department of Psychology, Zagreb Clinical Hospital Center. The diagnosis of PTSD was confirmed and verified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). A version of the Mississippi Scale for Combat Related PTSD (M-PTSD) standardized for the Croatian population was used to assess the severity of PTSD. In addition to the clinical interview, the existence of alexithymia was confirmed by the score on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TA S-20). Results A statistically significant association was found between the total number of diagnosed physical illnesses and the scores on three subscales of an alexithymia questionnaire, the TA S-20, with a 1% risk (p<0.01, 0.487; 0.450; 0.335). Regression analysis confirmed the most statistically significant predictive value of the first item of the TA S-20, which refers to difficulty in identifying feelings (=0.408, p=0.019). The total score on the M-PTSD scale correlated significantly to the subscales for alexithymia. There was a statistically significant negative correlation of the total score on the M-PTSD scale with social support. Conclusion The total scores obtained in this study, particularly those related to alexithymia, indicate the importance of this construct in the etiopathogenesis of somatic morbidity in the study population and confirm that as in other countries the TA S-20 is a useful instrument in Croatia for the assessment of this phenomenon.",The Connection between Alexithymia and Somatic Morbidity in a Population of Combat Veterans with Chronic PTSD,3610587,23572853.0,2013
"Background The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology and the Society of Nuclear Medicine conclude that incorporation of attenuation corrected (AC) images in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) will improve diagnostic accuracy. The aim was to investigate the value of adding AC stress-only images for the decision whether a rest study is necessary or not. Methods 1,261 patients admitted to  99m Tc MPS were studied. The stress studies were interpreted by two physicians who judged each study as “no rest study necessary” or “rest study necessary”, by evaluating NC stress-only and NC + AC stress-only images. When there was disagreement between the two physicians, a third physician evaluated the studies. Thus, agreement between 2 out of 3 physicians was evaluated. Results The physicians assessed 214 more NC + AC images than NC images as “no rest study necessary” (17% of the study population). The number of no-rest-study-required was significantly higher for NC + AC studies compared to NC studies (859 vs 645 cases (p < 0.0001). In the final report according to clinical routine, ischemia or infarction was reported in 23 patients, assessed as “no rest study necessary” (22 NC + AC cases; 8 NC cases), (no statistically significant difference). In 11 of these, the final report stated “suspected/possible ischemia or infarction in a small area”. Conclusions Adding AC stress-only images to NC stress-only images reduce the number of unnecessary rest studies substantially.",Adding attenuation corrected images in myocardial perfusion imaging reduces the need for a rest study,3618204,23547878.0,2013
"Background The frequency of CT procedures has registered a significant increase over the last decade, which led at the international level to an increasing concern on the radiological risk associated with the use of CT especially in paediatrics. This work aimed at investigating the use of computed tomography in Switzerland, following the evolution of CT frequency and dose data over a decade and comparing it to data reported in other countries. Methods The frequency and dose data related to CT are obtained by means of a nationwide survey. National frequencies were established by projecting the collected data, using the ratio of the number of CT units belonging to the respondents to the total number of CT units in the country. The effective doses per examination were collected during an auditing campaign. Results In 2008 about 0.8 Million CT procedures (~ 100 CT examinations / 1000 population) were performed in the country, leading to a collective effective dose of more than 6000 man.Sv (0.8 mSv/caput). In a decade the frequency of CT examinations averaged over the population and the associated average effective dose per caput increased by a factor of 2.2 and 2.9 respectively. Conclusions Although the contribution of CT to the total medical X-rays is 6% in terms of the frequency, it represents 68% in terms of the collective effective dose. These results are comparable to those reported in a number of countries in Europe and America with similar health level.",Exposure of the Swiss population to computed tomography,3733693,23895057.0,2013
"Background Diagnostic performance in breast screening programs may be influenced by the prior probability of disease. Since breast cancer incidence is roughly half a percent in the general population there is a large probability that the screening exam will be normal. That factor may contribute to false negatives. Screening programs typically exhibit about 83% sensitivity and 91% specificity. This investigation was undertaken to determine if a system could be developed to pre-sort screening-images into normal and suspicious bins based on their likelihood to contain disease. Wavelets were investigated as a method to parse the image data, potentially removing confounding information. The development of a classification system based on features extracted from wavelet transformed mammograms is reported. Methods In the multi-step procedure images were processed using 2D discrete wavelet transforms to create a set of maps at different size scales. Next, statistical features were computed from each map, and a subset of these features was the input for a concerted-effort set of naïve Bayesian classifiers. The classifier network was constructed to calculate the probability that the parent mammography image contained an abnormality. The abnormalities were not identified, nor were they regionalized. The algorithm was tested on two publicly available databases: the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Mammographic Images Analysis Society’s database (MIAS). These databases contain radiologist-verified images and feature common abnormalities including: spiculations, masses, geometric deformations and fibroid tissues. Results The classifier-network designs tested achieved sensitivities and specificities sufficient to be potentially useful in a clinical setting. This first series of tests identified networks with 100% sensitivity and up to 79% specificity for abnormalities. This performance significantly exceeds the mean sensitivity reported in literature for the unaided human expert. Conclusions Classifiers based on wavelet-derived features proved to be highly sensitive to a range of pathologies, as a result Type II errors were nearly eliminated. Pre-sorting the images changed the prior probability in the sorted database from 37% to 74%.",Automatic detection of anomalies in screening mammograms,4029799,24330643.0,2013
"Background Tubal and uterine cavity diseases commonly compromise female fertility. At the present time, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy with chromopertubation and RX-Hysterosalpingography (RX-HSG) are widely accepted screening procedures enabling the effective assessment of both tubal patency and uterine cavity. Nevertheless, consistent evidence supports the reliability of Hysterosalpingocontrast sonography (HyCoSy) in uterine cavity and tubal patency investigation, as a part of the standard infertility work-up. This prospective study was aimed at evaluating the tolerability of the technique as well as the incidence of related side effects and complications in a large series of infertile patients. Methods Pain perception of 632 infertile women was measured by means of an 11-point numeric rating scale. Side effects and late complications were also recorded. Results The mean numeric rating scale was 2.15 ± 2.0 SD. Most of the patients (374/632, 59.17%) rated HyCoSy as a non-painful procedure, whereas 24.36% (154/632) women reported mild pelvic pain and 9.96% (63/632) classified the discomfort as “moderate”. Only 6.48% (41/632) of the patient population experienced severe pelvic pain. Fifteen (2.37%) patients required drug administration for pain relief. Twenty-six patients (4.11%) showed mild vaso-vagal reactions that resolved without atropine administration. No severe vaso-vagal reactions or late complications were observed. Conclusions HyCoSy is a well-tolerated examination and the associated vagal effects are unusual and generally mild. Consequently, we support its introduction as a first-line procedure for tubal patency and uterine cavity investigation in infertile women.","Hysterosalpingocontrast sonography (HyCoSy): evaluation of the pain perception, side effects and complications",3765383,23968513.0,2013
"Background Sentinel node biopsy often results in the identification and removal of multiple nodes as sentinel nodes, although most of these nodes could be non-sentinel nodes. This study investigated whether computed tomography-lymphography (CT-LG) can distinguish sentinel nodes from non-sentinel nodes and whether sentinel nodes identified by CT-LG can accurately stage the axilla in patients with breast cancer. Methods This study included 184 patients with breast cancer and clinically negative nodes. Contrast agent was injected interstitially. The location of sentinel nodes was marked on the skin surface using a CT laser light navigator system. Lymph nodes located just under the marks were first removed as sentinel nodes. Then, all dyed nodes or all hot nodes were removed. Results The mean number of sentinel nodes identified by CT-LG was significantly lower than that of dyed and/or hot nodes removed (1.1 vs 1.8, p <0.0001). Twenty-three (12.5%) patients had ≥2 sentinel nodes identified by CT-LG removed, whereas 94 (51.1%) of patients had ≥2 dyed and/or hot nodes removed (p <0.0001). Pathological evaluation demonstrated that 47 (25.5%) of 184 patients had metastasis to at least one node. All 47 patients demonstrated metastases to at least one of the sentinel nodes identified by CT-LG. Conclusions CT-LG can distinguish sentinel nodes from non-sentinel nodes, and sentinel nodes identified by CT-LG can accurately stage the axilla in patients with breast cancer. Successful identification of sentinel nodes using CT-LG may facilitate image-based diagnosis of metastasis, possibly leading to the omission of sentinel node biopsy.",Sentinel nodes identified by computed tomography-lymphography accurately stage the axilla in patients with breast cancer,4028847,24321242.0,2013
"Background Carotid plaque echolucency as detected by Color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) has been used as a potential marker of plaque vulnerability. However, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has recently been shown to be a valuable method to evaluate the vulnerability and neovascularization within carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to compare CEUS and CDUS in the assessment of plaque vulnerability using transcranial color Doppler (TCD) monitoring of microembolic signals (MES) as a reference technique. Methods A total of 46 subjects with arterial stenosis (≥ 50%) underwent a carotid duplex ultrasound, TCD monitoring of MES and CEUS (SonoVue doses of 2.0 mL) within a span of 3 days. The agreement between the CEUS, CDUS, and MES findings was assessed with a chi-square test. A  p -value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Neovascularization was observed in 30 lesions (44.4%). The vascular risk factors for stroke were similar and there were no age or gender differences between the 2 groups. Using CEUS, MES were identified in 2 patients (12.5%) within class 1 (non-neovascularization) as opposed to 15 patients (50.0%) within class 2 (neovascularization) ( p  = 0.023). CDUS revealed no significant differences in the appearance of the MES between the 2 groups (hyperechoic and hypoechoic) ( p  = 0.237). Conclusion This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that intraplaque neovascularization detected by CEUS is associated with the presence of MESs, where as plaque echogenicity on traditional CDUS does not. These findings argue that CEUS may better identify high-risk plaques.",An assessment of the vulnerability of carotid plaques: a comparative study between intraplaque neovascularization and plaque echogenicity,3621161,23537052.0,2013

"Background Tissue Velocity Imaging (TVI) is an ultrasound based technique used for quantitative analysis of the cardiac function and has earlier been evaluated according to myocardial velocities. Recent years several studies have reported applying TVI in the analysis of skeletal muscles. Skeletal tissue velocities can be very low. In particular, when performing isometric contractions or contractions of low force level the velocities may be much lower compared to the myocardial tissue velocities. Methods In this study TVI was evaluated for estimation of tissue velocities below the typical myocardial velocities. An in-house phantom was used to see how different PRF-settings affected the accuracy of the velocity estimations. Results With phantom peak velocity at 0.03 cm/s the error ranged from 31% up to 313% with the different PRF-settings in this study. For the peak velocities at 0.17 cm/s and 0.26 cm/s there was no difference in error with tested PFR settings, it is kept approximately around 20%. Conclusions The results from the present study showed that the PRF setting did not seem to affect the accuracy of the velocity estimation at tissue velocities above 0.17 cm/s. However at lower velocities (0.03 cm/s) the setting was crucial for the accuracy. The PRF should therefore preferable be reduced when the method is applied in low-level muscle contraction.",Evaluation of ultrasound Tissue Velocity Imaging: a phantom study of velocity estimation in skeletal muscle low-level contractions,3680050,23758876.0,2013
"Background No study relating the changes obtained in the architecture of erector spinae (ES) muscle were registered with ultrasound and different intensities of muscle contraction recorded by surface EMG (electromyography) on the ES muscle was found. The aim of this study was analyse the relationship in the response of the ES muscle during isometric moderate and light lumbar isometric extension considering architecture and functional muscle variables. Methods Cross-sectional study. 46 subjects (52% men) with a group mean age of 30.4 (±7.78). The participants developed isometric lumbar extension while performing moderate and low isometric trunk and hip extension in a sitting position with hips flexed 90 degrees and the lumbar spine in neutral position. During these measurements, electromyography recordings and ultrasound images were taken bilaterally. Bilaterally pennation angle, muscle thickness, torque and muscle activation were measured. This study was developed at the human movement analysis laboratory of the Health Science Faculty of the University of Malaga (Spain). Results Strong and moderate correlations were found at moderate and low intensities contraction between the variable of the same intensity, with correlation values ranging from 0.726 (Torque Moderate – EMG Left Moderate) to 0.923 (Angle Left Light – Angle Right Light) (p < 0.001). This correlation is observed between the variables that describe the same intensity of contraction, showing a poor correlation between variables of different intensities. Conclusion There is a strong relationship between architecture and function variables of ES muscle when describe an isometric lumbar extension at light or moderate intensity.",Relationship of moderate and low isometric lumbar extension through architectural and muscular activity variables: a cross sectional study,3840670,24252273.0,2013
"Background Aggressive dose reduction strategies for cardiac CT require the prospective selection of limited cardiac phases. At lower heart rates, the period of mid-diastole is typically selected for image acquisition. We aimed to identify the effect of heart rate on the optimal CT acquisition phase within the period of mid-diastole. Methods We utilized high temporal resolution tissue Doppler to precisely measure coronary motion within diastole. Tissue-Doppler waveforms of the myocardium corresponding to the location of the circumflex artery (100 patients) and mid-right coronary arteries (50 patients) and the duration and timing of coronary motion were measured. Using regression analysis an equation was derived for the timing of the period of minimal coronary motion within the RR interval. In a validation set of 50 clinical cardiac CT examinations, we assessed coronary motion artifact and the effect of using a mid-diastolic imaging target that was adjusted according to heart rate vs a fixed 75% phase target. Results Tissue Doppler analysis shows the period of minimal cardiac motion suitable for CT imaging decreases almost linearly as the RR interval decreases, becoming extinguished at an average heart rate of 91 bpm for the circumflex (LCX) and 78 bpm for the right coronary artery (RCA). The optimal imaging phase has a strong linear relationship with RR duration (R 2  = 0.92 LCX, 0.89 RCA). The optimal phase predicted by regression analysis of the tissue-Doppler waveforms increases from 74% at a heart rate of 55 bpm to 77% at 75 bpm. In the clinical CT validation set, the optimal CT acquisition phase similarly occurred later with increasing heart rate. When the selected cardiac phase was adjusted according to heart rate the result was closer to the optimal phase than using a fixed 75% phase. While this effect was statistically significant (p < 0.01 RCA/LCx), the mean effect of heart-rate adjustment was minor relative to typical beat-to-beat variability and available precision of clinical phase selection. Conclusion High temporal resolution imaging of coronary motion can be used to predict the optimal acquisition phase in cardiac CT. The optimal phase for cardiac CT imaging within mid-diastole increases with increasing heart rate although the magnitude of change is small.",Defining the mid-diastolic imaging period for cardiac CT – lessons from tissue Doppler echocardiography,3570333,23375107.0,2013
"Background Circle contact lenses, also known as color contact lenses and big eye contact lenses, are a type of cosmetic contact lens. It is not generally known that a circle contact lens usually contains iron oxide and other metals, which means their use during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potential hazard. Case presentation We present a rare case of incidental discovery of circle contact lenses by MRI and MRI images of circle lenses in vitro. Conclusions Circle contact lenses usually contain iron oxide, which is a known source of susceptibility artifact on MRI.

"Background A major challenge in the development of cell based therapies for glioma is to deliver optimal number of cells (therapeutic dose) to the tumor. Imaging tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been used in cell tracking and/or biodistribution studies. In this study, we evaluate the dynamic biodistribution of systemic injected labeled cells [human cord blood derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs)] in rat glioma model with  in vivo  SPECT imaging. Methods Human cord blood EPCs, T-cells and CD14 +  cells (monocytes/dendritic cells) were isolated using the MidiMACS system. CD14 +  cells were converted to dendritic cells (DC) and also primed with U251 tumor cell line lysate. T-cells were co-cultured with irradiated primed DCs at 10:1 ratio to make CTLs. Both EPCs and CTLs were labeled with In-111-oxine at 37°C in serum free DMEM media. Glioma bearing animals were randomly assigned into three groups. In-111 labeled cells or In-111 oxine alone were injected through tail vein and SPECT imaging was performed on day 0, 1, and 3. In-111 oxine activity in various organs and tumor area was determined. Histochemical analysis was performed to further confirm the migration and homing of injected cells at the tumor site. Results EPCs and CTLs showed an In-111 labeling efficiency of 87.06 ± 7.75% and 70.8 ± 12.9% respectively. Initially cell migration was observed in lung following inravenous administration of In-111 labeled cells and decreased on day 1 and 3, which indicate re-distribution of labeled cells from lung to other organs. Relatively higher In-111 oxine activity was observed in tumor areas at 24 hours in animals received In-111 labeled cells (EPCs or CTLs). Histiological analysis revealed iron positive cells in and around the tumor area in animals that received labeled cells (CTLs and EPCs). Conclusion We observed differential biodistribution of In-111-oxine labeled EPCs and CTLs in different organs and intracranial glioma. This study indicates In-111 oxine based SPECT imaging is an effective tool to study the biodistribution of therapeutically important cells.",Differential biodistribution of intravenously administered endothelial progenitor and cytotoxic T-cells in rat bearing orthotopic human glioma,3706264,23758888.0,2013
"Background Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the most promising non-surgical treatments for hepatic tumors. The assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of RFA is usually obtained by visual comparison of pre- and post-treatment CT images, but no numerical quantification is performed. Methods In this work, a novel method aiming at providing a more objective tool for the evaluation of RFA coverage is described. Image registration and segmentation techniques were applied to enable the visualization of the tumor and the corresponding post-RFA necrosis in the same framework. In addition, a set of numerical indexes describing tumor/necrosis overlap and their mutual position were computed. Results After validation of segmentation step, the method was applied on a dataset composed by 10 tumors, suspected not to be completed treated. Numerical indexes showed that only two tumors were totally treated and the percentage of a residual tumor was in the range of 5.12%-35.92%. Conclusions This work represents a first attempt to obtain a quantitative tool aimed to assess the accuracy of RFA treatment. The possibility to visualize the tumor and the correspondent post-RFA necrosis in the same framework and the definition of some synthetic numerical indexes could help clinicians in ameliorating RFA treatment.",Radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors: quantitative assessment of tumor coverage through CT image processing,3626768,23324557.0,2013
"Background Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided wire localization presents several challenges apart from the technical difficulties. An alternative to this conventional localization method using a wire is the radio-guided occult lesion localization (ROLL), more related to safe surgical margins and reductions in excision volume. The purpose of this study was to establish a safe and reliable magnetic resonance imaging-radioguided occult lesion localization (MRI-ROLL) technique and to report our initial experience with the localization of nonpalpable breast lesions only observed on MRI. Methods Sixteen women (mean age 53.2 years) with 17 occult breast lesions underwent radio-guided localization in a 1.5-T MR system using a grid-localizing system. All patients had a diagnostic MRI performed prior to the procedure. An intralesional injection of Technetium-99m macro-aggregated albumin followed by distilled water was performed. After the procedure, scintigraphy was obtained. Surgical resection was performed with the help of a gamma detector probe. The lesion histopathology and imaging concordance; the procedure’s positive predictive value (PPV), duration time, complications, and accuracy; and the rate of exactly excised lesions evaluated with MRI six months after the surgery were assessed. Results One lesion in one patient had to be excluded because the radioactive substance came back after the injection, requiring a wire placement. Of the remaining cases, there were four malignant lesions, nine benign lesions, and three high-risk lesions. Surgical histopathology and imaging findings were considered concordant in all benign and high-risk cases. The PPV of MRI-ROLL was greater if the indication for the initial MR examination was active breast cancer. The median procedure duration time was 26 minutes, and all included procedures were defined as accurate. The exact and complete lesion removal was confirmed in all (100%) patients who underwent six-month postoperative MRI (50%).

"Background Cardiac lipomatous metaplasia (LM) occurs in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and heart failure with unclear mechanisms. We studied coronary occlusion/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rabbits during a 9-months follow-up using 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner, and confirmed the presence of MI in acute phase and LM in chronic phase using histopathology. Methods MI was surgically induced in 10 rabbits by 90-min coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Forty-eight hours later, multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) was performed at a 3.0 T clinical scanner for MI diagnosis and cardiac function analysis. Afterwards, seven rabbits were scarified for histochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), and hematoxylin-eosin (HE), and 3 were scanned with cMRI at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months and 9 months for longitudinal observations of morphological and functional changes, and the fate of the animals. Post-mortem TTC, HE and Masson's trichrome (MTC) were studied for chronic stage of MI. Results The size of acute MI correlated well between cMRI and TTC staining (r 2 =0.83). Global cardiac morphology-function analysis showed significant correlation between increasing acute MI size and decreasing ejection fraction (p<0.001). During 9 months, cMRI documented evolving morphological and functional changes from acute MI to chronic scar transformation and fat deposition with a definite diagnosis of LM established by histopathology. Conclusions Acute MI and chronic LM were induced in rabbits and monitored with 3.0 T MRI. Studies on this platform may help investigate the mechanisms and therapeutic interventions for LM.",Lipomatous metaplasia identified in rabbits with reperfused myocardial infarction by 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology,3707856,23815556.0,2013
"Background We previously demonstrated that superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging is promising for the detection of metastases in sentinel nodes localized by CT-lymphography in patients with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive criteria of the size of nodal metastases with SPIO-enhanced MR imaging in breast cancer, with histopathologic findings as reference standard. Methods This study included 150 patients with breast cancer. The patterns of SPIO uptake for positive sentinel nodes were classified into three; uniform high-signal intensity, partial high-signal intensity involving ≥50% of the node, and partial high-signal intensity involving <50% of the node. Imaging results were correlated with histopathologic findings. Results Thirty-three pathologically positive sentinel nodes from 30 patients were evaluated. High-signal intensity patterns that were uniform or involved ≥50% of the node were observed in 23 nodes that contained macro-metastases and no node that contained micro-metastases, while high-signal intensity patterns involving <50% of the node were observed in 2 nodes that contained macro-metastases and 8 nodes that contained micro-metastases. When the area of high-signal intensity was compared with the pathological size of the metastases, a pathologic >2 mm sentinel node metastases correlated with the area of high-signal intensity, however, a pathologic ≤2 mm sentinel node metastases did not. Conclusions High-signal intensity patterns that are uniform or involve ≥50% of the node are features of nodes with macro-metastases. The area of high-signal intensity correlated with the pathological size of metastases for nodes with metastases >2 mm in this series.",Correlation between the area of high-signal intensity on SPIO-enhanced MR imaging and the pathologic size of sentinel node metastases in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel nodes,3848752,24028426.0,2013
"Background The recently developed model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) enables significant reduction of image noise and artifacts, compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and filtered back projection (FBP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate lesion detectability of low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) with MBIR in comparison with ASIR and FBP. Methods Chest CT was acquired with 64-slice CT (Discovery CT750HD) with standard-dose (5.7 ± 2.3 mSv) and low-dose (1.6 ± 0.8 mSv) conditions in 55 patients (aged 72 ± 7 years) who were suspected of lung disease on chest radiograms. Low-dose CT images were reconstructed with MBIR, ASIR 50% and FBP, and standard-dose CT images were reconstructed with FBP, using a reconstructed slice thickness of 0.625 mm. Two observers evaluated the image quality of abnormal lung and mediastinal structures on a 5-point scale (Score 5 = excellent and score 1 = non-diagnostic). The objective image noise was also measured as the standard deviation of CT intensity in the descending aorta. Results The image quality score of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on low-dose MBIR CT (4.7 ± 0.5) was significantly improved in comparison with low-dose FBP and ASIR CT (3.0 ± 0.5, p = 0.004; 4.0 ± 0.5, p = 0.02, respectively), and was nearly identical to the score of standard-dose FBP image (4.8 ± 0.4, p = 0.66). Concerning decreased lung attenuation (bulla, emphysema, or cyst), the image quality score on low-dose MBIR CT (4.9 ± 0.2) was slightly better compared to low-dose FBP and ASIR CT (4.5 ± 0.6, p = 0.01; 4.6 ± 0.5, p = 0.01, respectively). There were no significant differences in image quality scores of visualization of consolidation or mass, ground-glass attenuation, or reticular opacity among low- and standard-dose CT series. Image noise with low-dose MBIR CT (11.6 ± 1.0 Hounsfield units (HU)) were significantly lower than with low-dose ASIR (21.1 ± 2.6 HU, p < 0.0005), low-dose FBP CT (30.9 ± 3.9 HU, p < 0.0005), and standard-dose FBP CT (16.6 ± 2.3 HU, p < 0.0005). Conclusion MBIR shows greater potential than ASIR for providing diagnostically acceptable low-dose CT without compromising image quality. With radiation dose reduction of >70%, MBIR can provide equivalent lesion detectability of standard-dose FBP CT.","CT of the chest with model-based, fully iterative reconstruction: comparison with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction",3847631,23927627.0,2013
"Background To evaluate the contrast agent performance of Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA for detection and assessment of extrahepatic findings, semi-quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods 13 patients with 19 extrahepatic lesions underwent liver MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA. Quantitative and relative SNR measurements were performed in each dataset in the arterial and portalvenous phase within the extrahepatic lesion, aorta, inferior vena cava, portal vein, spleen, pancreas and renal cortex. Further, relative CNR measurements were performed. Three readers assessed contrast quality using a five-point scale and choosing the preferred image dataset. Statistical analysis consisted of a Student’s t-test with  p  < 0.05 deemed significant, a weighted kappa statistic for assessment of interobserver variability and an ROC analysis. Results Mean SNR after injection of Gd-BOPTA was significantly higher compared with Gd-EOB-DTPA for all measurements ( p  < 0.05). Mean relative SNR was also higher for Gd-BOPTA, but without being statistically significant. There was no significant difference in relative CNR. Interobserver agreement for selection of image preference was moderate (mean weighted kappa 0.485). The area under the curve for the ROC-analysis regarding contrast agent performance was 0.464. Conclusion Even though mean SNR is significantly higher after injection of Gd-BOPTA compared with Gd-EOB-DTPA, there is no significant difference in relative CNR with extrahepatic lesions being assessed equally well. Visual impression may differ after injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA, but does not influence image interpretation. Extrahepatic findings can be assessed similarly to MRI after injection of Gd-BOPTA.",Lesion detection and assessment of extrahepatic findings in abdominal MRI using hepatocyte specific contrast agents – comparison of Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA,3610274,23506523.0,2013
"Background Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the male population. Fortunately, the prognosis is excellent if detected at an early stage. Hence, the detection and localization of prostate cancer is crucial for diagnosis, as well as treatment via targeted focal therapy. New imaging techniques can potentially be invaluable tools for improving prostate cancer detection and localization. Methods In this study, we introduce a new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging, where the tissue being imaged is characterized by the joint correlation of diffusion signal attenuation across multiple gradient pulse strengths and timings. By taking into account signal attenuation at different water diffusion motion sensitivities, correlated diffusion imaging can provide improved delineation between cancerous tissue and healthy tissue when compared to existing diffusion imaging modalities. Results Quantitative evaluation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, tissue class separability analysis, and visual assessment by an expert radiologist were performed to study correlated diffusion imaging for the task of prostate cancer diagnosis. These results are compared with that obtained using T2-weighted imaging and standard diffusion imaging (via the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)). Experimental results suggest that correlated diffusion imaging provide improved delineation between healthy and cancerous tissue and may have potential as a diagnostic tool for cancer detection and localization in the prostate gland. Conclusions A new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) was developed for the purpose of aiding radiologists in cancer detection and localization in the prostate gland. Preliminary results show CDI shows considerable promise as a diagnostic aid for radiologists in the detection and localization of prostate cancer.",Correlated diffusion imaging,3750835,23924150.0,2013
"Background Molecular imaging using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)—magnetic particle imaging (MPI)—has attracted interest for the early diagnosis of cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, because a steep local magnetic field distribution is required to obtain a defined image, sophisticated hardware is required. Therefore, it is desirable to realize excellent image quality even with low-performance hardware. In this study, the spatial resolution of MPI was evaluated using an image reconstruction method based on the correlation information of the magnetization signal in a time domain and by applying MNP samples made from biocompatible ferucarbotran that have adjusted particle diameters. Methods The magnetization characteristics and particle diameters of four types of MNP samples made from ferucarbotran were evaluated. A numerical analysis based on our proposed method that calculates the image intensity from correlation information between the magnetization signal generated from MNPs and the system function was attempted, and the obtained image quality was compared with that using the prototype in terms of image resolution and image artifacts. Results MNP samples obtained by adjusting ferucarbotran showed superior properties to conventional ferucarbotran samples, and numerical analysis showed that the same image quality could be obtained using a gradient magnetic field generator with 0.6 times the performance. However, because image blurring was included theoretically by the proposed method, an algorithm will be required to improve performance. Conclusions MNP samples obtained by adjusting ferucarbotran showed magnetizing properties superior to conventional ferucarbotran samples, and by using such samples, comparable image quality (spatial resolution) could be obtained with a lower gradient magnetic field intensity.",Evaluation of magnetic nanoparticle samples made from biocompatible ferucarbotran by time-correlation magnetic particle imaging reconstruction method,3684524,23734917.0,2013
"Background The surrogate indicator of radiological excellence that has become accepted is consistency of assessments between radiologists, and the technique that has become the standard for evaluating concordance is peer review. This study describes the results of a workstation-integrated peer review program in a busy outpatient radiology practice. Methods Workstation-based peer review was performed using the software program Intelerad Peer Review. Cases for review were randomly chosen from those being actively reported. If an appropriate prior study was available, and if the reviewing radiologist and the original interpreting radiologist had not exceeded review targets, the case was scored using the modified RADPEER system. Results There were 2,241 cases randomly assigned for peer review. Of selected cases, 1,705 (76%) were interpreted. Reviewing radiologists agreed with prior reports in 99.1% of assessments. Positive feedback (score 0) was given in three cases (0.2%) and concordance (scores of 0 to 2) was assigned in 99.4%, similar to reported rates of 97.0% to 99.8%. Clinically significant discrepancies (scores of 3 or 4) were identified in 10 cases (0.6%). Eighty-eight percent of reviewed radiologists found the reviews worthwhile, 79% found scores appropriate, and 65% felt feedback was appropriate. Two-thirds of radiologists found case rounds discussing significant discrepancies to be valuable. Conclusions The workstation-based computerized peer review process used in this pilot project was seamlessly incorporated into the normal workday and met most criteria for an ideal peer review system. Clinically significant discrepancies were identified in 0.6% of cases, similar to published outcomes using the RADPEER system. Reviewed radiologists felt the process was worthwhile.",A workstation-integrated peer review quality assurance program: pilot study,3711932,23822583.0,2013
"Background Standard MRI has been used for high-grade gliomas detection, albeit with limited success as it does not provide sufficient specificity and sensitivity to detect complex tumor structure. Therefore targeted contrast agents based on iron oxide, that shorten mostly T2 relaxation time, have been recently applied. However pulse sequences for molecular imaging in animal models of gliomas have not been yet fully studied. The aim of this study was therefore to compare contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and explain its origin using spin-echo (SE), gradient echo (GE), GE with flow compensation (GEFC) as well as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in T2 and T2* contrast-enhanced molecular MRI of glioma. Methods A mouse model was used. U87MGdEGFRvIII cells (U87MG), derived from a human tumor, were injected intracerebrally. A 9.4 T MRI system was used and MR imaging was performed on the 10 day after the inoculation of the tumor. The CNR was measured prior, 20 min, 2 hrs and 24 hrs post intravenous tail administration of glioma targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) using SE, SWI, GE and GEFC pulse sequences. Results The results showed significant differences in CNR among all pulse sequences prior injection. GEFC provided higher CNR post contrast agent injection when compared to GE and SE. Post injection CNR was the highest with SWI and significantly different from any other pulse sequence. Conclusions Molecular MR imaging using targeted contrast agents can enhance the detection of glioma cells at 9.4 T if the optimal pulse sequence is used. Hence, the use of flow compensated pulse sequences, beside SWI, should to be considered in the molecular imaging studies.",Comparison of T  and T -weighted MR molecular imaging of a mouse model of glioma,3726375,23865826.0,2013
"Background This paper considers automatic segmentation of the left cardiac ventricle in short axis magnetic resonance images. Various aspects, such as the presence of papillary muscles near the endocardium border, makes simple threshold based segmentation difficult. Methods The endo- and epicardium are modelled as two series of radii which are inter-related using features describing shape and motion. Image features are derived from edge information from human annotated images. The features are combined within a discriminatively trained Conditional Random Field (CRF). Loopy belief propagation is used to infer segmentations when an unsegmented video sequence is given. Powell’s method is applied to find CRF parameters by minimizing the difference between ground truth annotations and the inferred contours. We also describe how the endocardium centre points are calculated from a single human-provided centre point in the first frame, through minimization of frame alignment error. Results We present and analyse the results of segmentation. The algorithm exhibits robustness against inclusion of the papillary muscles by integrating shape and motion information. Possible future improvements are identified. Conclusions The presented model integrates shape and motion information to segment the inner and outer contours in the presence of papillary muscles. On the Sunnybrook dataset we find an average Dice metric of 0.91±0.02 and 0.93±0.02 for the inner and outer segmentations, respectively. Particularly problematic are patients with hypertrophy where the blood pool disappears from view at end-systole.",Left ventricular segmentation from MRI datasets with edge modelling conditional random fields,3737053,23899437.0,2013
"Background To investigate the imaging features of primary sarcomas of the great vessels in CT, MRI and  18  F-FDG PET/CT. Methods Thirteen patients with a primary sarcoma of the great vessels were retrospectively evaluated. All available images studies including F-18 FDG PET(/CT) (n = 4), MDCT (n = 12) and MRI (n = 6) were evaluated and indicative image features of this rare tumor entity were identified. Results The median interval between the first imaging study and the final diagnosis was 11 weeks (0–12 weeks). The most frequently observed imaging findings suggestive of malignant disease in patients with sarcomas of the pulmonary arteries were a large filling defect with vascular distension, unilaterality and a lack of improvement despite effective anticoagulation. In patients with aortic sarcomas we most frequently observed a pedunculated appearance and an atypical location of the filling defect. The F-18 FDG PET(/CT) examinations demonstrated an unequivocal hypermetabolism of the lesion in all cases (4/4). MRI proved lesion vascularization in 5/6 cases. Conclusion Intravascular unilateral or atypically located filling defects of the great vessels with vascular distension, a pedunculated shape and lack of improvement despite effective anticoagulation are suspicious for primary sarcoma on MDCT or MRI. MR perfusion techniques can add information on the nature of the lesion but the findings may be subtle and equivocal. F-18 FDG PET/CT may have a potential role in these patients and may be considered as part of the imaging workup.","Imaging features of primary Sarcomas of the great vessels in CT, MRI and PET/CT: a single-center experience",3750466,23924063.0,2013
"Background Fine needle aspiration biopsy is usually performed to evaluate thyroid lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of diffusion weighted imaging to differentiate malignancy of thyroid lesions. Methods The study was approved by ethics committee of Shanghai Changzheng Hospital.Forty-two patients, 10 men and 32 women (range: 20–72 years, mean age 42.4 years) with thyroid lesions were included in the study. Routine neck MR and diffusion-weighted MR imaging was performed using multiple b-values. ADC values were computed for the different b-values. Histological results of the thyroidectomy samples were obtained for all the patients. ADC values of benign and malignant thyroid lesions were compared with the pathology results. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect independent parameters for differentiating benign and malignancy of lesions. Result Based on the histology results there were 28 benign and 14 malignant cases. The difference of ADC value between benign and malignant thyroid lesions was significant for ADC values obtained using b-values of 0 and 300 s/mm 2  (p < 0.001). The ADC values were significantly higher in benign lesions (benign ADC: 2.37 ± 0.47 × 10-3 mm 2 /s vs. malignant: 1.49 ± 0.60 × 10-3 mm 2 /s). ADC values obtained with b-values of 0 and 300 mm 2 /s and max nodular diameter was regarded as the two most discriminative parameters for differentiating malignancy. Using the pathology results as a standard reference, area under ROC curve was found to be 0.876 for an ADC cutoff value of 2.17 × 10-3 mm 2 /s that corresponded to an acquisition with b-values of 0 and 300 mm 2 /s. Conclusion Diffusion-weighted MR imaging is a promising non-invasive method to differentiate malignancy in thyroid lesions.",Diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in thyroid disease: application in differentiating benign from malignant disease,3750353,23899414.0,2013
"Background This paper presents a method that registers MRIs acquired in prone position, with surface topography (TP) and X-ray reconstructions acquired in standing position, in order to obtain a 3D representation of a human torso incorporating the external surface, bone structures, and soft tissues. Methods TP and X-ray data are registered using landmarks. Bone structures are used to register each MRI slice using an articulated model, and the soft tissue is confined to the volume delimited by the trunk and bone surfaces using a constrained thin-plate spline. Results The method is tested on 3 pre-surgical patients with scoliosis and shows a significant improvement, qualitatively and using the Dice similarity coefficient, in fitting the MRI into the standing patient model when compared to rigid and articulated model registration. The determinant of the Jacobian of the registration deformation shows higher variations in the deformation in areas closer to the surface of the torso. Conclusions The novel, resulting 3D full torso model can provide a more complete representation of patient geometry to be incorporated in surgical simulators under development that aim at predicting the effect of scoliosis surgery on the external appearance of the patient’s torso.",Multimodal image registration of the scoliotic torso for surgical planning,3602289,23289431.0,2013
"Background To evaluate whether Contrast Enhanced Ultrasund (CEUS) with microbubbles (MBs) targeted to VEGFR-2 is able to characterize  in vivo  the VEGFR-2 expression in the tumor vasculature of a mouse model of thyroid cancer (Tg-TRK-T1). Methods Animal protocol was approved by Institutional committee on Laboratory Animal Care. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging with MBs targeted with an anti-VEGFR-2 monoclonal antibody (UCA VEGFR-2 ) and isotype control antibody (UCA IgG ) was performed in 7 mice with thyroid carcinoma, 5 mice with hyperplasia or benign thyroid nodules and 4 mice with normal thyroid. After ultrasonography, the tumor samples were harvested for histological examination and VEGFR-2 expression was tested by immunohistochemistry. Data were reported as median and range. Paired non parametric Wilcoxon’s test and ANOVA of Kruskal-Wallis were used. The correlation between the contrast signal and the VEGFR-2 expression was assessed by the Spearman coefficient. Results The Video intensity difference (VI D ) caused by backscatter of the retained UCA VEGFR-2  was significantly higher in mice harboring thyroid tumors compared to mice with normal thyroids ( P  < 0.01) and to mice harboring benign nodules ( P  < 0.01). No statistically significant differences of VI D  were observed in the group of mice carrying benign nodules compared to mice with normal thyroids. Moreover in thyroid tumors VI D  of retained VEGFR-2-targeted UCA was significantly higher than that of control UCA IgG  ( P  <0.05). Results of immunohistochemical analysis confirmed VEGFR-2 overexpression. The magnitude of the molecular ultrasonographic signal from a VEGFR-2-targeted UCA retained by tissue correlates with VEGFR-2 expression determined by immunohistochemistry ( rho  0.793,  P =0.0003). Conclusions We demonstrated that CEUS with UCA VEGFR-2  might be used for  in vivo  non invasive detection and quantification of VEGFR-2 expression in thyroid cancer in mice, and to differentiate benign from malignant thyroid nodules.",Imaging of thyroid tumor angiogenesis with microbubbles targeted to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 in mice,3848463,24028408.0,2013
"Background Automated whole breast ultrasound scanners of the latest generation have reached a level of comfortable application and high quality volume acquisition. Nevertheless, there is a lack of data concerning this technology. We investigated the diagnostic performance and inter-observer concordance of the Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) ACUSON S2000™ and questioned its implications in breast cancer diagnostics. Methods We collected 100 volume data sets and created a database containing 52 scans with no detectable lesions in conventional ultrasound (BI-RADS®-US 1), 30 scans with benign lesions (BI-RADS®-US 2) and 18 scans with breast cancer (BI-RADS®-US 5). Two independent examiners evaluated the ABVS data on a separate workstation without any prior knowledge of the patients’ histories. Results The inter-rater reliability reached fair agreement (κ=0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19-0.53). With respect to the true category, the conditional inter-rater validity coefficient was κ=0.18 (95% CI: 0.00-0.26) for the benign cases and κ=0.80 (95% CI: 0.61-1.00) for the malignant cases. Combining the assessments of examiner 1 and examiner 2, the diagnostic accuracy (AC), sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for the experimental ABVS were AC = 79.0% (95% CI: 67.3-86.1), SE = 83.3% (95% CI: 57.7-95.6) and SP = 78.1% (% CI: 67.3-86.1), respectively. However, after the ABVS examination, there were a high number of requests for second-look ultrasounds in up to 48.8% of the healthy women due to assumed suspicious findings in the volume data. In an exploratory analysis, we estimated that an ABVS examination in addition to mammography alone could detect a relevant number of previously occult breast cancers (about 1 cancer in 300 screened and otherwise healthy women). Conclusions The ABVS is a reliable imaging method for the evaluation of the breast with high sensitivity and a fair inter-observer concordance. However, we have to overcome the problem of the high number of false-positive results. Therefore, further prospective studies in larger collectives are necessary to define standard procedures in image acquisition and interpretation. Nevertheless, we consider the ABVS as being suitable for integration into breast diagnostics as a beneficial and reliable imaging method.",Diagnostic performance and inter-observer concordance in lesion detection with the automated breast volume scanner (ABVS),3831756,24219312.0,2013
"Background Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies typically employ either a single expert or multiple readers in collaboration to evaluate (read) the image results. However, no study has examined whether evaluations from multiple readers provide more reliable results than a single reader. We examined whether consistency in image interpretation by a single expert might be equal to the consistency of combined readings, defined as independent interpretations by two readers, where cases of disagreement were reconciled by consensus. Methods One expert neuroradiologist and one trained radiology resident independently evaluated 102 MRIs of the upper neck. The signal intensities of the alar and transverse ligaments were scored 0, 1, 2, or 3. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. They repeated the grading process after 3–8 months (second evaluation). We used kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to assess agreement between the initial and second evaluations for each radiologist and for combined determinations. Disagreements on score prevalence were evaluated with McNemar’s test. Results Higher consistency between the initial and second evaluations was obtained with the combined readings than with individual readings for signal intensity scores of ligaments on both the right and left sides of the spine. The weighted kappa ranges were 0.65-0.71 vs. 0.48-0.62 for combined vs. individual scoring, respectively. The combined scores also showed better agreement between evaluations than individual scores for the presence of grade 2–3 signal intensities on any side in a given subject (unweighted kappa 0.69-0.74 vs. 0.52-0.63, respectively). Disagreement between the initial and second evaluations on the prevalence of grades 2–3 was less marked for combined scores than for individual scores ( P  ≥ 0.039 vs.  P  ≤ 0.004, respectively). ICCs indicated a more reliable sum score per patient for combined scores (0.74) and both readers’ average scores (0.78) than for individual scores (0.55-0.69). Conclusions This study was the first to provide empirical support for the principle that an additional reader can improve the reproducibility of MRI interpretations compared to one expert alone. Furthermore, even a moderately experienced second reader improved the reliability compared to a single expert reader. The implications of this for clinical work require further study.",Are two readers more reliable than one? A study of upper neck ligament scoring on magnetic resonance images,3626747,23327567.0,2013
"Background There has been much recent interest in the quantification of visually evident heterogeneity within functional grayscale medical images, such as those obtained via magnetic resonance or positron emission tomography. In the case of images of cancerous tumors, variations in grayscale intensity imply variations in crucial tumor biology. Despite these considerable clinical implications, there is as yet no standardized method for measuring the heterogeneity observed via these imaging modalities. Methods In this work, we motivate and derive a statistical measure of image heterogeneity. This statistic measures the distance-dependent average deviation from the smoothest intensity gradation feasible. We show how this statistic may be used to automatically rank images of  in vivo  human tumors in order of increasing heterogeneity. We test this method against the current practice of ranking images via expert visual inspection. Results We find that this statistic provides a means of heterogeneity quantification beyond that given by other statistics traditionally used for the same purpose. We demonstrate the effect of tumor shape upon our ranking method and find the method applicable to a wide variety of clinically relevant tumor images. We find that the automated heterogeneity rankings agree very closely with those performed visually by experts. Conclusions These results indicate that our automated method may be used reliably to rank, in order of increasing heterogeneity, tumor images whether or not object shape is considered to contribute to that heterogeneity. Automated heterogeneity ranking yields objective results which are more consistent than visual rankings. Reducing variability in image interpretation will enable more researchers to better study potential clinical implications of observed tumor heterogeneity.",Quantification of heterogeneity observed in medical images,3682890,23453000.0,2013
"Background Psoas abscess complicating tuberculous spondylitis is a rare morbidity in extrapulmonary tuberculosis. There are no established guidelines for evaluating the clinical response of psoas abscess. Although several studies have shown that positron emission tomography-computed tomography with  18  F-fluorodeoxyglucose can play a potential role in diagnosing multifocal tuberculosis and monitoring the clinical response of pulmonary tuberculosis, to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that positron emission tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluating local inflammation and disease activity of a tuberculous psoas abscess. Case presentation We report a case of multifocal bone and lymph node tuberculosis with concomitant lumbar psoas abscess in a 77-year-old man, along with a literature review. An initial positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan showed intense  18  F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the sternum, ribs, vertebrae, and lymph nodes. The patient was successfully treated with antitubercular agents and computed tomography-guided drainage therapy. A follow-up positron emission tomography-computed tomography after abscess drainage and 9 months of antitubercular drug treatment revealed that the majority of lesions improved; however, protracted inflammation surrounding the psoas abscess was still observed. These results indicate that disease activity of psoas abscess can remain, even after successful drainage and antitubercular medication regime of appropriate duration. Conclusion We have successfully followed up the extent of skeletal tuberculosis complicated with psoas abscess by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. In this patient, positron emission tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluating the disease activity of tuberculous psoas abscess and for assessing the appropriate duration of antitubercular drug therapy in psoas abscess.",A case of skeletal tuberculosis and psoas abscess: disease activity evaluated using   F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography,3831053,24225333.0,2013
"Background Activity of disease in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is monitored by detecting and delineating hyper-intense lesions on MRI scans. The Minimum Area Contour Change (MACC) algorithm has been created with two main goals: a) to improve inter-operator agreement on outlining regions of interest (ROIs) and b) to automatically propagate longitudinal ROIs from the baseline scan to a follow-up scan. Methods The MACC algorithm first identifies an outer bound for the solution path, forms a high number of iso-contour curves based on equally spaced contour values, and then selects the best contour value to outline the lesion. The MACC software was tested on a set of 17 FLAIR MRI images evaluated by a pair of human experts and a longitudinal dataset of 12 pairs of T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images that had lesion analysis ROIs drawn by a single expert operator. Results In the tests where two human experts evaluated the same MRI images, the MACC program demonstrated that it could markedly reduce inter-operator outline error. In the longitudinal part of the study, the MACC program created ROIs on follow-up scans that were in close agreement to the original expert’s ROIs. Finally, in a post-hoc analysis of 424 follow-up scans 91% of propagated MACC were accepted by an expert and only 9% of the final accepted ROIS had to be created or edited by the expert. Conclusion When used with an expert operator's verification of automatically created ROIs, MACC can be used to improve inter- operator agreement and decrease analysis time, which should improve data collected and analyzed in multicenter clinical trials.",Improved operator agreement and efficiency using the minimum area contour change method for delineation of hyperintense multiple sclerosis lesions on FLAIR MRI,3766707,24004511.0,2013
"Background Correct sagittal alignment with a balanced pelvis and spine is crucial in the management of spinal disorders. The pelvic incidence (PI) describes the sagittal pelvic alignment and is position-independent. It has barely been investigated on CT scans. Furthermore, no studies have focused on the association between PI and facet joint (FJ) arthritis and orientation. Therefore, our goal was to clarify the remaining issues about PI in regard to (1) physiologic values, (2) age, (3) gender, (4) lumbar lordosis (LL) and (5) FJ arthritis and orientation using CT scans. Methods We retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 620 individuals, with a mean age of 43 years, who presented to our traumatology department and underwent a whole body CT scan, between 2008 and 2010. The PI was determined on sagittal CT planes of the pelvis by measuring the angle between the hip axis to an orthogonal line originating at the center of the superior end plate axis of the first sacral vertebra. We also evaluated LL, FJ arthritis and orientation of the lumbar spine. Results 596 individuals yielded results for (1) PI with a mean of 50.8°. There was no significant difference for PI and (2) age, nor (3) gender. PI was significantly and linearly correlated with (4) LL (p = < 0.0001). Interestingly, PI and (5) FJ arthritis displayed a significant and linear correlation (p = 0.0062) with a cut-off point at 50°. An increased PI was also significantly associated with more sagitally oriented FJs at L5/S1 (p = 0.01). Conclusion PI is not correlated with age nor gender. However, this is the first report showing that PI is significantly and linearly associated with LL, FJ arthritis and more sagittal FJ orientation at the lower lumbar spine. This may be caused by a higher contact force on the lower lumbar FJs by an increased PI. Once symptomatic or in the event of spinal trauma, patients with increased PI and LL could benefit from corrective surgery and spondylodesis.",Increased pelvic incidence may lead to arthritis and sagittal orientation of the facet joints at the lower lumbar spine,4228336,24188071.0,2013
"Background The collagenous structure of menisci is a complex network of circumferentially oriented fascicles and interwoven radially oriented tie-fibres. To date, examination of this micro- architecture has been limited to two-dimensional imaging techniques. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the three-dimensional imaging technique; optical projection tomography (OPT), to visualize the collagenous structure of the meniscus. If successful, this technique would be the first to visualize the macroscopic orientation of collagen fascicles in 3-D in the meniscus and could further refine load bearing mechanisms in the tissue. OPT is an imaging technique capable of imaging samples on the meso-scale (1-10 mm) at a micro-scale resolution. The technique, similar to computed tomography, takes two-dimensional images of objects from incremental angles around the object and reconstructs them using a back projection algorithm to determine three-dimensional structure. Methods Bovine meniscal samples were imaged from four locations (outer main body, femoral surface, tibial surface and inner main body) to determine the variation in collagen orientation throughout the tissue. Bovine stifles (n = 2) were obtained from a local abattoir and the menisci carefully dissected. Menisci were fixed in methanol and subsequently cut using a custom cutting jig (n = 4 samples per meniscus). Samples were then mounted in agarose, dehydrated in methanol and subsequently cleared using benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate (BABB) and imaged using OPT. Results Results indicate circumferential, radial and oblique collagenous orientations at the contact surfaces and in the inner third of the main body of the meniscus. Imaging identified fascicles ranging from 80-420 μm in diameter. Transition zones where fascicles were found to have a woven or braided appearance were also identified. The outer-third of the main body was composed of fascicles oriented predominantly in the circumferential direction. Blood vessels were also visualized using this technique, as their elastin content fluoresces more brightly than collagen at the 425 nm wavelength used by the OPT scanner. Conclusions OPT was capable of imaging the collagenous structure, as well as blood vessels in the bovine meniscus. Collagenous structure variability, including transition zones between structural regions not previously described in the meniscus, was identified using this novel technique.",An evaluation of meniscal collagenous structure using optical projection tomography,3726444,23879345.0,2013
"Background Chronic Achilles tendinosis is a common problem. When evaluating and comparing different therapies there is a need for reliable imaging methods. Our aim was to evaluate if chronic Achilles tendinosis affects the dynamic contrast-enhancement in the tendon and its surroundings and if short-term eccentric calf-muscle training normalizes the dynamic contrast-enhancement. Methods 20 patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy were included. Median duration of symptoms was 31 months (range 6 to 120 months). Both Achilles tendons were examined with dynamic contrast enhanced MRI before and after a 12- week exercise programme of eccentric calf-muscle training. The dynamic MRI was evaluated in tendon, vessel and in fat ventrally of tendon. Area under the curve (AUC), time to peak of signal, signal increase per second (SI/s) and increase in signal between start and peak as a percentage (SI%) was calculated. Pain and performance were evaluated using a questionnaire. Results In the fat ventrally of the tendon, dynamic contrast enhancement was significantly higher in the symptomatic leg compared to the contralateral non-symptomatic leg before but not after treatment. Despite decreased pain and improved performance there was no significant change of dynamic contrast enhancement in symptomatic tendons after treatment. Conclusion In Achilles tendinosis there is an increased contrast enhancement in the fat ventrally of the tendon. The lack of correlation with symptoms and the lack of significant changes in tendon contrast enhancement parameters do however indicate that dynamic enhanced MRI is currently not a useful method to evaluate chronic Achilles tendinosis.",Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in chronic Achilles tendinosis,4222571,24261480.0,2013
"Background Correct characterization of focal solid hepatic lesions has always been a challenge and is of great diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. The purpose of this study was to determine the added value of hepatobiliary phase images in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for differentiating focal solid hepatic lesions. Methods In this retrospective trial 84 consecutive patients underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR examinations. MRI was conducted for 64 patients with malignant focal hepatic lesions (34 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 30 metastases) and for 20 patients with benign hepatic lesions (14 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), 3 adenoma, 3 hemangioma). Five radiologists independently reviewed three sets of MR images by means of a 5-point confidence scale from score 1 (definitely benign) to score 5 (definitely malignant): set 1: unenhanced images; set 2: unenhanced and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced dynamic images; set 3: hepatobiliary phase images in addition to set 2. Accuracy was assessed by the alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic curve (A z ) and the index of diagnostic performance was calculated. Results Diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved by the addition of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced dynamic images: A z  in set 1 was 0.708 and 0.833 in set 2 (P = 0.0002). The addition of hepatobiliary phase images increased the A z  value to 0.941 in set 3 (set 3 vs set 2, P < 0.0001; set 3 vs set 1, P < 0.0001). The index of diagnostic performance was lowest in set 1 (45%), improved in set 2 (71%), and highest in set 3 (94%).

"Background Cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis is associated with a poor prognosis. In patients with right sided heart failure, differentiating between cor-pulmonale, or cardiac sarcoidosis has important implications to management. Case presentation We present the case of a patient with severe but stable pulmonary sarcoidosis and new onset right sided heart failure despite only mild elevations of pulmonary artery pressure. CMR demonstration of extensive right ventricular fibrosis with associated dilatation and hypokinesis was a key finding for prognosis and management of the patient.

"Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of a noninvasive ultrasound-based method, vibro-acoustography (VA), for thyroid imaging and determine the feasibility and challenges of VA in detecting nodules in thyroid. Methods Our study included two parts. First, in an  in vitro  study, experiments were conducted on a number of excised thyroid specimens randomly taken from autopsy. Three types of images were acquired from most of the specimens: X-ray, B-mode ultrasound, and vibro-acoustography. The second and main part of the study includes results from performing VA and B-mode ultrasound imaging on 24 human subjects with thyroid nodules. The results were evaluated and compared qualitatively. Results In vitro  vibro-acoustography images displayed soft tissue structures, microcalcifications, cysts and nodules with high contrast and no speckle. In this group, all of US proven nodules and all of X-ray proven calcifications of thyroid tissues were detected by VA.  In vivo  results showed 100% of US proven calcifications and 91% of the US detected nodules were identified by VA, however, some artifacts were present in some cases. Conclusions In vitro  and  in vivo  VA images show promising results for delineating the detailed structure of the thyroid, finding nodules and in particular calcifications with greater clarity compare to US. Our findings suggest that, with further development, VA may be a suitable imaging modality for clinical thyroid imaging.",thyroid vibro-acoustography: a pilot study,3618245,23530993.0,2013
"Background To evaluate the inter-study, inter-reader and intra-reader reproducibility of cardiac cine and scar imaging in rats using a clinical 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) system. Methods Thirty-three adult rats (Sprague–Dawley) were imaged 24 hours after surgical occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery using a 3.0 Tesla clinical MR scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) equipped with a dedicated 70 mm solenoid receive-only coil. Left-ventricular (LV) volumes, mass, ejection fraction and amount of myocardial scar tissue were measured. Intra-and inter-observer reproducibility was assessed in all animals. In addition, repeat MR exams were performed in 6 randomly chosen rats within 24 hours to assess inter-study reproducibility. Results The MR imaging protocol was successfully completed in 32 (97%) animals. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated high intra-reader reproducibility (mean bias%: LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), -1.7%; LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), -2.2%; LV ejection fraction (LVEF), 1.0%; LV mass, -2.7%; and scar mass, -1.2%) and high inter-reader reproducibility (mean bias%: LVEDV, 3.3%; LVESV, 6.2%; LVEF, -4.8%; LV mass, -1.9%; and scar mass, -1.8%). In addition, a high inter-study reproducibility was found (mean bias%: LVEDV, 0.1%; LVESV, -1.8%; LVEF, 1.0%; LV mass, -4.6%; and scar mass, -6.2%). Conclusions Cardiac MR imaging of rats yielded highly reproducible measurements of cardiac volumes/function and myocardial infarct size on a clinical 3.0 Tesla MR scanner system. Consequently, more widely available high field clinical MR scanners can be employed for small animal imaging of the heart e.g. when aiming at serial assessments during therapeutic intervention studies.",Reproducibility of small animal cine and scar cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using a clinical 3.0 tesla system,3878577,24345214.0,2013
"Background Previous data using T1-weighted MRI demonstrated neck muscle fat infiltration (MFI) in patients with poor functional recovery following whiplash. Such findings do not occur in those with milder symptoms of whiplash, chronic non-traumatic neck pain or healthy controls, suggesting traumatic factors play a role. Muscle degeneration could potentially represent a quantifiable marker of poor recovery, but the temporal constraints of running a T1-weighted sequence and performing the subsequent analysis for muscle fat may be a barrier for clinical translation. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate, quantify and compare MFI for the cervical multifidus muscles with T1-weighted imaging and a more rapid quantitative 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) Dixon based method in healthy subjects. Methods 5 asymptomatic participants with no history of neck pain underwent cervical spine MRI with a Siemens 3 Tesla system. The muscle and fat signal intensities on axial spin-echo T1-weighted images were quantitatively classified for the cervical multifidii from C3-C7, bilaterally. Additional axial GRE Dixon based data for fat and water quantification were used for comparison via paired t-tests. Inter-tester reliability for fat and water measures with GRE images were examined using 1) Pearson’s Intra-class correlation coefficient 2) Bland-Altman Plots and 3) Lin’s-Concordance Coefficient. P < 0.05 was used to indicate significance. Results Total mean (SD) MFI (C3-C7) for the multifidii obtained with T1-weighted imaging and GRE were 18.4% (3.3) (range 14-22%) and 18.8% (2.9) (range 15-22%), respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for inter-tester reliability on the GRE sequences for the C3-C7 multifidii ranged from .83 - .99, indicating high levels of agreement with segmental MFI measures. Bland-Altman Plots revealed all data points were within 2 SDs and concordance was established between 2-blinded raters, suggesting good agreement between two raters measuring fat and water with GRE imaging. Conclusions Results of this preliminary study demonstrate reliability between 2 raters of varying experience for MRI analysis of MFI with 3D GRE MRI. The quantification of MFI for healthy cervical musculature is comparable to T1-weighted images.

"Background Automatic cancer diagnostic systems based on histological image classification are important for improving therapeutic decisions. Previous studies propose textural and morphological features for such systems. These features capture patterns in histological images that are useful for both cancer grading and subtyping. However, because many of these features lack a clear biological interpretation, pathologists may be reluctant to adopt these features for clinical diagnosis. Methods We examine the utility of biologically interpretable shape-based features for classification of histological renal tumor images. Using Fourier shape descriptors, we extract shape-based features that capture the distribution of stain-enhanced cellular and tissue structures in each image and evaluate these features using a multi-class prediction model. We compare the predictive performance of the shape-based diagnostic model to that of traditional models, i.e., using textural, morphological and topological features. Results The shape-based model, with an average accuracy of 77%, outperforms or complements traditional models. We identify the most informative shapes for each renal tumor subtype from the top-selected features. Results suggest that these shapes are not only accurate diagnostic features, but also correlate with known biological characteristics of renal tumors. Conclusions Shape-based analysis of histological renal tumor images accurately classifies disease subtypes and reveals biologically insightful discriminatory features. This method for shape-based analysis can be extended to other histological datasets to aid pathologists in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.",Histological image classification using biologically interpretable shape-based features,3623732,23497380.0,2013
"Background Non-invasive imaging of the biodistribution of novel therapeutics including gene therapy vectors in animal models is essential. Methods This study assessed the utility of high-frequency ultrasound (HF-US) combined with biofluoresence imaging (BFI) to determine the longitudinal impact of a Herpesvirus saimiri amplicon on human colorectal cancer xenograft growth. Results HF-US imaging of xenografts resulted in an accurate and informative xenograft volume in a longitudinal study. The volumes correlated better with final  ex vivo  volume than mechanical callipers (R 2  = 0.7993, p = 0.0002 vs. R 2  = 0.7867, p = 0.0014). HF-US showed that the amplicon caused lobe formation. BFI demonstrated retention and expression of the amplicon in the xenografts and quantitation of the fluorescence levels also correlated with tumour volumes. Conclusions The use of multi-modal imaging provided useful and enhanced insights into the behaviour of gene therapy vectors  in vivo  in real-time.

"Background The heart is subject to structural and functional changes with advancing age. However, the magnitude of cardiac age-dependent transformation has not been conclusively elucidated. Methods This retrospective cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) study included 183 subjects with normal structural and functional ventricular values. End systolic volume (ESV), end diastolic volume (EDV), and ejection fraction (EF) were obtained from the left and the right ventricle in breath-hold cine CMR. Patients were classified into four age groups (20–29, 30–49, 50–69, and ≥70 years) and cardiac measurements were compared using Pearson’s rank correlation over the four different groups. Results With advanced age a slight but significant decrease in ESV (r=−0.41 for both ventricles, P<0.001) and EDV (r=−0.39 for left ventricle, r=−0.35 for right ventricle, P<0.001) were observed associated with a significant increase in left (r=0.28, P<0.001) and right (r=0.27, P<0.01) ventricular EF reaching a maximal increase in EF of +8.4% (P<0.001) for the left and +6.1% (P<0.01) for the right ventricle in the oldest compared to the youngest patient group. Left ventricular myocardial mass significantly decreased over the four different age groups (P<0.05). Conclusions The aging process is associated with significant changes in left and right ventricular EF, ESV and EDV in subjects with no cardiac functional and structural abnormalities. These findings underline the importance of using age adapted values as standard of reference when evaluating CMR studies.",Age-related normal structural and functional ventricular values in cardiac function assessed by magnetic resonance,3626771,23391039.0,2013
"Background Concerns have been raised regarding growth in advanced diagnostic imaging use. This study evaluated trends in national outpatient MRI/CT utilization rates during 2000-2009 and factors associated with utilization. Methods This retrospective database analysis used data on all respondents in the nationally representative U.S. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) during 2000-2009. Visits involving advanced diagnostic imaging were identified based on self-reported use of MRI or CT tests at emergency departments, office-based medical providers, and outpatient departments. The imaging utilization rate was defined as the number of outpatient visits with MRI/CT per 1,000 person-years. Results were weighted to create nationally representative estimates at the person-year level for each year and the pooled 10-year period. A multivariate logistic regression was estimated to identify predictors of imaging use. Results A total of 319,246 person-years were included in the analysis. MRI/CT utilization rates increased from 64.3 to 109.1 per 1,000 person years from 2000 to 2009, with older persons, females and Medicare enrollees having higher rates of use. Growth in imaging slowed in recent years; the average annual decline in the imaging growth rate was larger than that for all outpatient services (4.7% vs. 0.9%). The percentage of respondents with MRI/CT use (6.7% during 2000-2009) also increased at a slower rate in later years and declined during 2007-2009. The average number of MRI/CT visits among imaging users was steady at about 1.5 visits during 2000-2009. Age, female gender, White race, HMO participation, and all payer types (vs. uninsured) were significant predictors of imaging use. Compared to 2005, years 2000-2003 were associated with a significantly lower likelihood of imaging use, while years 2004-2009 were not significantly associated, suggesting a slow-down in later years. Conclusions Growth in advanced imaging utilization appears to have slowed in recent years, a finding of potential interest to policy-makers and payers.","National trends in advanced outpatient diagnostic imaging utilization: an analysis of the medical expenditure panel survey, 2000-2009",4222739,24279724.0,2013

"Graphical abstract In vivo imaging of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) can potentially provide insights into the activation of neuronal pathways and aid the diagnosis of a number of neurological diseases. The iminodihydroquinoline WIN17317-3 is one of the most potent sodium channel blockers reported to date and binds with high affinity to VGSCs throughout the rat brain. We have synthesized a  125 I-labeled analogue of WIN17317-3 and evaluated the potential of the tracer for imaging of VGSCs with SPECT. Automated patch clamp studies with CHO cells expressing the Na v 1.2 isoform and displacement studies with [ 3 H]BTX yielded comparable results for the non-radioactive iodinated iminodihydroquinoline and WIN17317-3. However, the  125 I-labeled tracer was rapidly metabolized in vivo, and suffered from low brain uptake and high accumulation of radioactivity in the intestines.

"In response to toxic stimuli, BCL2L11 (also known as BIM), a BH3-only protein, is released from its interaction with dynein light chain 1 (DYNLL1 also known as LC8) and can induce apoptosis by inactivating anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins and by activating BAX-BAK1. Recently, we discovered that BCL2L11 interacts with BECN1 (Beclin 1), and that this interaction is facilitated by DYNLL1. BCL2L11 recruits BECN1 to microtubules by bridging BECN1 and DYNLL1, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In starvation conditions, BCL2L11 is phosphorylated by MAPK8/JNK and this phosphorylation abolishes the BCL2L11-DYNLL1 interaction, allowing dissociation of BCL2L11 and BECN1, thereby ameliorating autophagy inhibition. This finding demonstrates a novel function of BIM beyond its roles in apoptosis, highlighting the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, and suggests that BCL2L11’s dual effects in inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis may have important roles in disease pathogenesis.",BCL2L11/BIM A novel molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis,3542209,23064249.0,2013
"To study mitochondrial protein age dynamics, we targeted a time-sensitive fluorescent protein, MitoTimer, to the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial age was revealed by the integrated portions of young (green) and old (red) MitoTimer protein. Mitochondrial protein age was dependent on turnover rates as pulsed synthesis, decreased import, or autophagic inhibition all increased the proportion of aged MitoTimer protein. Mitochondrial fusion promotes the distribution of young mitochondrial protein across the mitochondrial network as cells lacking essential fusion genes  Mfn1  and  Mfn2  displayed increased heterogeneity in mitochondrial protein age. Experiments in hippocampal neurons illustrate that the distribution of older and younger mitochondrial protein within the cell is determined by subcellular spatial organization and compartmentalization of mitochondria into neurites and soma. This effect was altered by overexpression of mitochondrial transport protein, RHOT1/MIRO1. Collectively our data show that distribution of young and old protein in the mitochondrial network is dependent on turnover, fusion, and transport.","MitoTimer probe reveals the impact of autophagy, fusion, and motility on subcellular distribution of young and old mitochondrial protein and on relative mitochondrial protein age",4028338,24149000.0,2013
"Salinomycin is perhaps the first promising compound that was discovered through high throughput screening in cancer stem cells. This novel agent can selectively eliminate breast and other cancer stem cells, though the mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we found that salinomycin induced autophagy in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that salinomycin stimulated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mediated autophagy via the ATF4-DDIT3/CHOP-TRIB3-AKT1-MTOR axis. Moreover, we found that the autophagy induced by salinomycin played a prosurvival role in human NSCLC cells and attenuated the apoptotic cascade. We also showed that salinomycin triggered more apoptosis and less autophagy in A549 cells in which  CDH1  expression was inhibited, suggesting that the inhibition of autophagy might represent a promising strategy to target cancer stem cells. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that combination treatment with salinomycin and pharmacological autophagy inhibitors will be an effective therapeutic strategy for eliminating cancer cells as well as cancer stem cells.",Salinomycin induces cell death with autophagy through activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress in human cancer cells,3722315,23670030.0,2013
"Fluorescent Timer, or DsRed1-E5, is a mutant of the red fluorescent protein, dsRed, in which fluorescence shifts over time from green to red as the protein matures. This molecular clock gives temporal and spatial information on protein turnover. To visualize mitochondrial turnover, we targeted Timer to the mitochondrial matrix with a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (coined “MitoTimer”) and cloned it into a tetracycline-inducible promoter construct to regulate its expression. Here we report characterization of this novel fluorescent reporter for mitochondrial dynamics. Tet-On HEK 293 cells were transfected with pTRE-tight-MitoTimer and production was induced with doxycycline (Dox). Mitochondrial distribution was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and verified by subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis. Dox addition for as little as 1 h was sufficient to induce MitoTimer expression within 4 h, with persistence in the mitochondrial fraction for up to 6 d. The color-specific conformation of MitoTimer was stable after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Ratiometric analysis of MitoTimer revealed a time-dependent transition from green to red over 48 h and was amenable to analysis by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry of whole cells or isolated mitochondria. A second Dox administration 48 h after the initial induction resulted in a second round of expression of green MitoTimer. The extent of new protein incorporation during a second pulse was increased by administration of a mitochondrial uncoupler or simvastatin, both of which trigger mitophagy and biogenesis. MitoTimer is a novel fluorescent reporter protein that can reveal new insights into mitochondrial dynamics within cells.

"Increasing evidence suggests oxidative damage as a key factor contributing to the failure of the conventional outflow pathway tissue to maintain appropriate levels of intraocular pressure, and thus increase the risk for developing glaucoma, a late-onset disease which is the second leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Autophagy is emerging as an essential cellular survival mechanism against a variety of stressors, including oxidative stress. Here, we have monitored, by using different methodologies (LC3-I to LC3-II turnover, tfLC3, and Cyto ID), the induction of autophagy and autophagy flux in TM cells subjected to a normobaric hyperoxic model of mild chronic oxidative stress. Our data indicate the MTOR-mediated activation of autophagy and nuclear translocation of TFEB in oxidatively stressed TM cells, as well as the role of autophagy in the occurrence of SA-GLB1/SA-β-gal. Concomitant with the activation of the autophagic pathway, TM cells grown under oxidative stress conditions displayed, however, reduced cathepsin (CTS) activities, reduced lysosomal acidification and impaired CTSB proteolytic maturation, resulting in decreased autophagic flux. We propose that diminished autophagic flux induced by oxidative stress might represent one of the factors leading to progressive failure of cellular TM function with age and contribute to the pathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma.",Lysosomal basification and decreased autophagic flux in oxidatively stressed trabecular meshwork cells Implications for glaucoma pathogenesis,3627672,23360789.0,2013

"Autophagosomes are formed by double-membraned structures, which engulf portions of cytoplasm. Autophagosomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes, where their contents are degraded. The origin of the autophagosome membrane may involve different sources, such as mitochondria, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and recycling endosomes. We recently observed that ATG9 localizes on the plasma membrane in clathrin-coated structures and is internalized following a classical endocytic pathway through early and then recycling endosomes. By contrast, ATG16L1 is also internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis but via different clathrin-coated pits, and appears to follow a different route to the recycling endosomes. The R-SNARE VAMP3 mediates the coalescence of the 2 different pools of vesicles (containing ATG16L1 or ATG9) in recycling endosomes. The heterotypic fusion between ATG16L1- and ATG9-containing vesicles strongly correlates with subsequent autophagosome formation. Thus, ATG9 and ATG16L1 both traffic from the plasma membrane to autophagic precursor structures and provide 2 routes from the plasma membrane to autophagosomes.",ATG16L1 meets ATG9 in recycling endosomes Additional roles for the plasma membrane and endocytosis in autophagosome biogenesis,4389876,24257061.0,2013
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a prototype of mutant  KIT  oncogene-driven tumor. Prolonged tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment may result in a resistant phenotype through acquired secondary  KIT  mutation. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90AA1) is a chaperone protein responsible for protein maturation and stability, and KIT is a known client protein of HSP90AA1. Inhibition of HSP90AA1 has been shown to destabilize KIT protein by enhancing its degradation via the proteasome-dependent pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that NVP-AUY922 (AUY922), a new class of HSP90AA1 inhibitor, is effective in inhibiting the growth of GIST cells expressing mutant KIT protein, the imatinib-sensitive GIST882 and imatinib-resistant GIST48 cells. The growth inhibition was accompanied with a sustained reduction of both total and phosphorylated KIT proteins and the induction of apoptosis in both cell lines. Surprisingly, AUY922-induced KIT reduction could be partially reversed by pharmacological inhibition of either autophagy or proteasome degradation pathway. The blockade of autophagy alone led to the accumulation of the KIT protein, highlighting the role of autophagy in endogenous KIT turnover. The involvement of autophagy in endogenous and AUY922-induced KIT protein turnover was further confirmed by the colocalization of KIT with MAP1LC3B-, acridine orange- or SQSTM1-labeled autophagosome, and by the accumulation of KIT in GIST cells by silencing either  BECN1  or  ATG5  to disrupt autophagosome activity. Therefore, the results not only highlight the potential application of AUY922 for the treatment of KIT-expressing GISTs, but also provide the first evidence for the involvement of autophagy in endogenous and HSP90AA1 inhibitor-induced KIT degradation.",Autophagy is involved in endogenous and NVP-AUY922-induced KIT degradation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors,3552885,23196876.0,2013

This provides a model consistent with Braak’s hypothesis on progressive PD. The loss of visual function is specific for the  G2019S  mutation, implying the cause is its increased kinase activity, and is enhanced by increased neuronal activity.

"Failure to engage apoptosis appears to be a leading mechanism of resistance to traditional platinum drugs in patients with ovarian cancer. Therefore, an alternative strategy to induce cell death is needed for the chemotherapy of this apoptosis-resistant cancer. Here we report that autophagic cell death, distinct from cisplatin-induced apoptosis, is triggered by a novel monofunctional platinum (II) complex named Mono-Pt in human ovarian carcinoma cells. Mono-Pt-induced cell death has the following features: cytoplasmic vacuolation, caspase-independent, no nuclear fragmentation or chromatin condensation, and no apoptotic bodies. These characteristics integrally indicated that Mono-Pt, rather than cisplatin, initiated a nonapoptotic cell death in Caov-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Furthermore, incubation of the cells with Mono-Pt but not with cisplatin produced an increasing punctate distribution of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and an increasing ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. Mono-Pt also caused the formation of autophagic vacuoles as revealed by monodansylcadaverine staining and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, Mono-Pt-induced cell death was significantly inhibited by the knockdown of either  BECN1  or  ATG7  gene expression, or by autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine, chloroquine and bafilomycin A 1 . Moreover, the effect of Mono-Pt involved the AKT1-MTOR-RPS6KB1 pathway and MAPK1 (ERK2)/MAPK3 (ERK1) signaling, since the MTOR inhibitor rapamycin increased, while the MAPK1/3 inhibitor U0126 decreased Mono-Pt-induced autophagic cell death. Taken together, our results suggest that Mono-Pt exerts anticancer effect via autophagic cell death in apoptosis-resistant ovarian cancer. These findings lead to increased options for anticancer platinum drugs to induce cell death in cancer.","Novel monofunctional platinum (II) complex Mono-Pt induces apoptosis-independent autophagic cell death in human ovarian carcinoma cells, distinct from cisplatin",3722334,23580233.0,2013
"Tumor hypoxia underlies treatment failure and yields more aggressive and metastatic cancer phenotypes. Although therapeutically targeting these hypoxic environments has been proposed for many years, to date no approaches have shown the therapeutic value to gain regulatory approval. Here, we demonstrated that a novel hypoxia-activated prodrug, Q6, exhibits potent antiproliferative efficacy under hypoxic conditions and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, with no obvious toxicity being detected in 2 normal liver cell lines. Treatment with Q6 markedly downregulated HIF1A [hypoxia inducible factor 1, α subunit (basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor)] expression and transcription of the downstream target gene,  VEGFA  (vascular endothelial growth factor A). This dual hypoxia-targeted modulation mechanism leads to high potency in suppressing tumor growth and vascularization in 2 in vivo models. Intriguingly, it is the autophagy-dependent degradation pathway that plays a crucial role in Q6-induced attenuation of HIF1A expression, rather than the proteasome-dependent pathway, which is normally regarded as the predominant mechanism underlying posttranslational regulation of HIF1A. Inhibition of autophagy, either by short interfering RNA (siRNA) or by chemical inhibitors, blocked Q6-induced HIF1A degradation. Autophagic degradation of HIF1A was further confirmed by the observation that HIF1A coimmunoprecipitated with the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein, SQSTM1, which is degraded through autophagy. Additionally, silencing of  SQSTM1  inhibited Q6-induced HIF1A degradation. These findings suggest that the novel hypoxia-targeted agent, Q6, has potential clinical value in the therapy of HCC.

We recently discovered “RNautophagy,” an autophagic pathway in which RNA is directly taken up by lysosomes and degraded. A lysosomal membrane protein, LAMP2C, a splice variant of LAMP2, binds to RNA and acts as a receptor for this pathway. In the present study, we show that DNA is also directly taken up by lysosomes and degraded. Like RNautophagy, this autophagic pathway, which we term “DNautophagy,” is dependent on ATP. The cytosolic sequence of LAMP2C also directly interacts with DNA, and LAMP2C functions as a receptor for DNautophagy, in addition to RNautophagy. Similarly to RNA, DNA binds to the cytosolic sequences of fly and nematode LAMP orthologs. Together with the findings of our previous study, our present findings suggest that RNautophagy and DNautophagy are evolutionarily conserved systems in Metazoa.",Direct uptake and degradation of DNA by lysosomes,3748189,23839276.0,2013
"During early embryogenesis, before the conceptus forms the placenta, maternal nutrients as well as signaling molecules must reach the embryo proper through a tightly sealed epithelial tissue, the visceral endoderm (VE). The VE serves as a signaling center for embryogenesis, where exocytic and endocytic processes integrate signal production, perception and termination. However, the endocytic process in this important tissue has not been well characterized. We show that endocytic delivery to the lysosomes occurs via RAB7-dependent microautophagy. This process is essential for early mammalian development.",Microautophagy in the visceral endoderm is essential for mouse early development,3552893,23108279.0,2013
"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex, degenerative and progressive eye disease that usually does not lead to complete blindness, but can result in severe loss of central vision. Risk factors for AMD include age, genetics, diet, smoking, oxidative stress and many cardiovascular-associated risk factors. Autophagy is a cellular housekeeping process that removes damaged organelles and protein aggregates, whereas heterophagy, in the case of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), is the phagocytosis of exogenous photoreceptor outer segments. Numerous studies have demonstrated that both autophagy and heterophagy are highly active in the RPE. To date, there is increasing evidence that constant oxidative stress impairs autophagy and heterophagy, as well as increases protein aggregation and causes inflammasome activation leading to the pathological phenotype of AMD. This review ties together these crucial pathological topics and reflects upon autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in AMD.",Autophagy and heterophagy dysregulation leads to retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and development of age-related macular degeneration,3722332,23590900.0,2013
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms promoting therapy resistance is important. Previously, we reported that VEGFC can promote cancer cell survival during stress via interaction with its receptor NRP2. While examining the molecular mechanisms involved in this survival, we performed a microarray study in which we identified two genes,  WDFY1  and  LAMP2 , which have been suggested to function in autophagy. Our subsequent studies further confirmed the regulation of autophagy by the VEGFC-NRP2 axis in cancer during starvation- and chemotherapy-induced stress. We are currently in the process of determining the mechanism(s) through which WDFY1 and LAMP2 control autophagy; however, we did observe an increase in MTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) activity after the depletion of the VEGFC-NRP2 axis. It would therefore be interesting to study whether WDFY1 and LAMP2 can influence MTORC1 activity and regulate autophagy. Taken together, our data suggest that targeting the VEGFC-NRP2 axis in combination with chemotherapy could be an effective treatment for advanced cancers.",Angiogenic growth factor axis in autophagy regulation,3669190,23388383.0,2013
"Lysosomal storage diseases are metabolic disorders characterized by the accumulation of acidic vacuoles, and are usually the consequence of the deficiency of an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of vesicular lipids, proteins or carbohydrates. In contrast, mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), results from the absence of a vesicular Ca 2+  release channel called mucolipin 1/transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1/TRPML1) which is required for the fusion of amphisomes with lysosomes. In Drosophila, ablation of the  MCOLN1  homolog ( trpml ) leads to diminished viability during pupation when the animals rely on autophagy for nutrients. This pupal lethality results from decreased target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling, and is reversed by reactivating TORC1. Our findings indicate that one of the primary causes of toxicity in the absence of TRPML is cellular amino acid starvation, and the resulting decrease in TORC1 activity. Furthermore, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that the neurological dysfunction in MLIV patients may arise from amino acid deprivation in neurons. Therefore, future studies evaluating the levels of amino acids and TORC1 activity in MLIV neurons may aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat the severe manifestations of MLIV.",Feast or famine Role of TRPML in preventing cellular amino acid starvation,3542223,23047439.0,2013
"Autophagic responses to chemotherapeutic agents may vary greatly among different prostate cancer cells and have not been well characterized. In this study, we showed that valproic acid (VPA) induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and formation of LC3 puncta, the typical markers of autophagy, in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. However, these markers were undetectable in DU145 cells upon autophagic stimulation, indicating a defect of autophagy in this cell line. Among several critical autophagy-related proteins, ATG5 and ATG12–ATG5 conjugates, which are essential for autophagy induction, were absent in DU145 cells. No canonical transcripts for full-length  ATG5  but only two alternatively spliced  ATG5  transcripts were identified in DU145 cells. These alternative transcripts lack one or two exons, leading to premature termination of  ATG5  translation. Transfection of the wild-type  ATG5  gene into DU145 cells rescued the production of ATG5 and ATG12–ATG5 conjugates, resulting in formation of LC3-II conjugates and LC3 puncta. Moreover, the levels of the SQSTM1 protein, which should be degradable as an autophagy adaptor, were much higher in DU145 than in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, but were significantly decreased after ATG5 restoration in DU145 cells. However, expression of wild-type ATG5 in DU145 or knockdown of ATG5 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells did not change the inhibitory effects of VPA on these cells. Collectively, these results indicated that VPA-induced autophagy in prostate cancer cells depended on ATG5 and more importantly, that the autophagy pathway was genetically impaired in DU145 cells, suggesting caution in interpreting autophagic responses in this cell line.","Autophagy is differentially induced in prostate cancer LNCaP, DU145 and PC-3 cells via distinct splicing profiles of ATG5",3542215,23075929.0,2013
"Hydrogen sulfide is already recognized as an important signaling molecule in mammalian systems, and emerging data suggest that H 2 S is a signaling molecule just as important as nitric oxide (NO) and H 2 O 2  in plants. Although sulfide is generated in chloroplasts and mitochondria, it is present predominantly in the charged HS -  form due to the basic pH inside both organelles, thus requiring an active transporter, which is yet to be identified, to be released. In Arabidopsis, we found that the cytosolic  L -cysteine desulfhydrase DES1 is involved in the degradation of cysteine, and therefore responsible for the generation of H 2 S in this cellular compartment. DES1 deficiency leads to the induction of autophagy. Moreover, we have demonstrated that sulfide in particular exerts a general effect on autophagy through negative regulation, in a way unrelated to nutrient deficiency. The mechanisms of H 2 S action and its molecular targets are largely unknown, although in animal systems, protein S-sulfhydration has been proposed as a mechanism for sulfide-mediated signaling.",Sulfide as a signaling molecule in autophagy,3627676,23328265.0,2013
"Phagocytosis and autophagy are typically dedicated to degradation of substrates of extrinsic and intrinsic origins respectively. Although overlaps between phagocytosis and autophagy were reported, the use of autophagy for ingested substrate degradation by nonprofessional phagocytes has not been described. Blood-separated tissues use their tissue-specific nonprofessional phagocytes for homeostatic phagocytosis. In the testis, Sertoli cells phagocytose spermatid residual bodies produced during germ cell differentiation. In the retina, pigmented epithelium phagocytoses shed photoreceptor tips produced during photoreceptor renewal. Spermatid residual bodies and shed photoreceptor tips are phosphatidylserine-exposing substrates. Activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor MERTK, which is implicated in phagocytosis of phosphatidylserine-exposing substrates, is a common feature of Sertoli and retinal pigmented epithelial cell phagocytosis. The major aim of our study was to investigate to what extent phagocytosis by Sertoli cells may be tissue specific. We analyzed in Sertoli cell cultures that were exposed to either spermatid residual bodies (legitimate substrates) or retina photoreceptor outer segments (illegitimate substrates) the course of the main phagocytosis stages. We show that whereas substrate binding and ingestion stages occur similarly for legitimate or illegitimate substrates, the degradation of illegitimate but not of legitimate substrates triggers autophagy as evidenced by the formation of double-membrane wrapping, MAP1LC3A-II/LC3-II clustering, SQSTM1/p62 degradation, and by marked changes in ATG5, ATG9 and BECN1/Beclin 1 protein expression profiles. The recruitment by nonprofessional phagocytes of autophagy for the degradation of ingested cell-derived substrates is a novel feature that may be of major importance for fundamentals of both apoptotic substrate clearance and tissue homeostasis.",A chimerical phagocytosis model reveals the recruitment by Sertoli cells of autophagy for the degradation of ingested illegitimate substrates,3669177,23439251.0,2013
"Amino acids, leucine in particular, are known to inhibit autophagy, at least in part by their ability to stimulate MTOR-mediated signaling. Evidence is presented showing that glutamate dehydrogenase, the central enzyme in amino acid catabolism, contributes to leucine sensing in the regulation of autophagy. The data suggest a dual mechanism by which glutamate dehydrogenase activity modulates autophagy, i.e., by activating MTORC1 and by limiting the formation of reactive oxygen species.",Glutamate dehydrogenase contributes to leucine sensing in the regulation of autophagy,3672295,23575388.0,2013
"Listeria monocytogenes  is a bacterial pathogen that can escape the phagosome and replicate in the cytosol of host cells during infection. We previously observed that a population (up to 35%) of  L. monocytogenes  strain 10403S colocalize with the macroautophagy marker LC3 at 1 h postinfection. This is thought to give rise to  s pacious  L isteri a -containing  p hagosomes (SLAPs), a membrane-bound compartment harboring slow-growing bacteria that is associated with persistent infection. Here, we examined the host and bacterial factors that mediate LC3 recruitment to bacteria at 1 h postinfection. At this early time point, LC3 +  bacteria were present within single-membrane phagosomes that are LAMP1 + . Protein ubiquitination is known to play a role in targeting cytosolic  L. monocytogenes  to macroautophagy. However, we found that neither protein ubiquitination nor the ubiquitin-binding adaptor SQSTM1/p62 are associated with LC3 +  bacteria at 1 h postinfection. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the CYBB/NOX2 NADPH oxidase was also required for LC3 recruitment to bacteria at 1 h postinfection and for subsequent SLAP formation. Diacylglycerol is an upstream activator of the CYBB/NOX2 NADPH oxidase, and its production by both bacterial and host phospholipases was required for LC3 recruitment to bacteria. Our data suggest that the LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) pathway, which is distinct from macroautophagy, targets  L. monocytogenes  during the early stage of infection within host macrophages and allows establishment of an intracellular niche (SLAPs) associated with persistent infection.",Host and bacterial factors that regulate LC3 recruitment to   during the early stages of macrophage infection,3722333,23584039.0,2013
"Autophagy is induced by many cytotoxic stimuli but it is often unclear whether, under specific conditions, autophagy plays a prosurvival or a prodeath role. To answer this critical question we developed a novel methodology that employs automated live microscopy and image analysis to measure autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously in single cells. We used this approach to perform a systems-level analysis of pathway dynamics for both autophagy and apoptosis. We found that induction of autophagy in response to different stimuli is uniformly unimodal; in contrast, cells induce apoptosis in an all-or-none bimodal fashion. By tracking the fate of single cells we found that autophagy precedes apoptosis, and that within the same population apoptosis is delayed in cells that mount a stronger autophagy response. Inhibition of autophagy by knocking down  ATG5  promoted apoptosis, thus confirming that autophagy plays a protective role. We anticipate that our single-cell approach will be a powerful tool for gaining a quantitative understanding of the complex regulation of autophagy, its influence on cell fate decisions and its relationship with other cellular pathways.",Live imaging and single-cell analysis reveal differential dynamics of autophagy and apoptosis,4026027,23748697.0,2013
